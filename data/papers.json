      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can encode complex relationships in their latent\nspaces, yet harnessing them for optimization under uncertainty remains\nchallenging. We address this gap with a novel architecture that reframes LLM\nfinetuning as Gaussian process (GP) marginal likelihood optimization via deep\nkernel methods. We introduce LLM-based deep kernels, jointly optimized with GPs\nto preserve the benefits of both - LLMs to provide a rich and flexible input\nspace for Bayesian optimization and - GPs to model this space with predictive\nuncertainty for more efficient sampling. Applied to Buchwald-Hartwig reaction\noptimization, our method nearly doubles the discovery rate of high-performing\nreactions compared to static LLM embeddings (from 24% to 43% coverage of the\ntop 5% reactions in just 50 optimization iterations). We also observe a 14%\nimprovement over domain-specific representations without requiring specialized\nfeatures. Extensive empirical evaluation across 19 benchmarks - ranging from\ngeneral chemistry to reaction and molecular property optimization -\ndemonstrates our method's robustness, generality, and consistent improvements\nacross: (1) tasks, (2) LLM architectures (encoder, decoder, encoder-decoder),\n(3) pretraining domains (chemistry-related or general-purpose) and (4)\nhyperparameter settings (tuned once on a single dataset). Finally, we explain\nthese improvements: joint LLM-GP optimization through marginal likelihood\nimplicitly performs contrastive learning, aligning representations to produce\n(1) better-structured embedding spaces, (2) improved uncertainty calibration,\nand (3) more efficient sampling - without requiring any external loss. This\nwork provides both practical advances in sample-efficient optimization and\ninsights into what makes effective Bayesian optimization.",

In this paper, we are motivated by two major gaps in\nexisting work on FL and DG: (1) the lack of formal mathematical analysis of DG\nobjectives and training processes; and (2) DG research in FL being limited to\nthe conventional star-topology architecture. Addressing the second gap, we\ndevelop $\\textit{Decentralized Federated Domain Generalization with Style\nSharing}$ ($\\texttt{StyleDDG}$), a fully decentralized DG algorithm designed to\nallow devices in a peer-to-peer network to achieve DG based on sharing style\ninformation inferred from their datasets.

In this paper, we provide an overview of the\nstate of the art in this continuously evolving field. The survey sheds light on\nthe motivational reasons for pursuing classifiers selection through\nmeta-learning. In this regard, Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is usually\ntreated as an ASP problem under the umbrella of the democratization of machine\nlearning. Accordingly, AutoML makes machine learning techniques accessible to\ndomain scientists who are interested in applying advanced analytics but lack\nthe required expertise. It can ease the task of manually selecting ML\nalgorithms and tuning related hyperparameters. We comprehensively discuss the\ndifferent phases of classifiers selection based on a generic framework that is\nformed as an outcome of reviewing prior works. Subsequently, we propose a\nbenchmark knowledge base of 4 millions previously learned models and present\nextensive comparative evaluations of the prominent methods for classifiers\nselection based on 08 classification algorithms and 400 benchmark datasets.

To address this, we introduce TxGemma, a suite\nof efficient, generalist large language models (LLMs) capable of therapeutic\nproperty prediction as well as interactive reasoning and explainability. Unlike\ntask-specific models, TxGemma synthesizes information from diverse sources,\nenabling broad application across the therapeutic development pipeline. The\nsuite includes 2B, 9B, and 27B parameter models, fine-tuned from Gemma-2 on a\ncomprehensive dataset of small molecules, proteins, nucleic acids, diseases,\nand cell lines. Across 66 therapeutic development tasks, TxGemma achieved\nsuperior or comparable performance to the state-of-the-art generalist model on\n64 (superior on 45), and against state-of-the-art specialist models on 50\n(superior on 26). Fine-tuning TxGemma models on therapeutic downstream tasks,\nsuch as clinical trial adverse event prediction, requires less training data\nthan fine-tuning base LLMs, making TxGemma suitable for data-limited\napplications. Beyond these predictive capabilities, TxGemma features\nconversational models that bridge the gap between general LLMs and specialized\nproperty predictors.

This paper first explores the impact of different teachers\nin GNN-to-MLP distillation.

Building\non these insights, we propose Ensemble Heuristic-Distilled MLPs (EHDM), which\neliminates graph dependencies while effectively integrating complementary\nsignals via a gating mechanism.

      "abstract": "Software requirements expressed in natural language (NL) frequently suffer\nfrom verbosity, ambiguity, and inconsistency. This creates a range of\nchallenges, including selecting an appropriate architecture for a system and\nassessing different architectural alternatives. Relying on human expertise to\naccomplish the task of mapping NL requirements to architecture is\ntime-consuming and error-prone. This paper proposes ARLO, an approach that\nautomates this task by leveraging (1) a set of NL requirements for a system,\n(2) an existing standard that specifies architecturally relevant software\nquality attributes, and (3) a readily available Large Language Model (LLM).\nSpecifically, ARLO determines the subset of NL requirements for a given system\nthat is architecturally relevant and maps that subset to a tailorable matrix of\narchitectural choices. ARLO applies integer linear programming on the\narchitectural-choice matrix to determine the optimal architecture for the\ncurrent requirements. We demonstrate ARLO's efficacy using a set of real-world\nexamples. We highlight ARLO's ability (1) to trace the selected architectural\nchoices to the requirements and (2) to isolate NL requirements that exert a\nparticular influence on a system's architecture. This allows the\nidentification, comparative assessment, and exploration of alternative\narchitectural choices based on the requirements and constraints expressed\ntherein.",

Specifically, TEAM represents each\nvideo with a fixed set of pattern tokens that capture globally discriminative\nclues within the video instance regardless of action length or speed, ensuring\nits flexibility. Furthermore, TEAM is inherently efficient, using token-wise\ncomparisons to measure similarity between videos, unlike existing methods that\nrely on pairwise comparisons for temporal alignment. Additionally, we propose\nan adaptation process that identifies and removes common information across\nclasses, establishing clear boundaries even between novel categories. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TEAM. Codes are available at\ngithub.com/leesb7426/TEAM.",

Worse still, the IP-Adapter's dependency on\nopen-source image encoders reduces the knowledge required to craft AEs.\nExtensive experiments verify the technical feasibility of the hijacking attack.\nIn light of the revealed threat, we investigate several existing defenses and\nexplore combining the IP-Adapter with adversarially trained models to overcome\nexisting defenses' limitations.

      "abstract": "Human Activity Recognition (HAR) primarily relied on traditional RGB cameras\nto achieve high-performance activity recognition. However, the challenging\nfactors in real-world scenarios, such as insufficient lighting and rapid\nmovements, inevitably degrade the performance of RGB cameras. To address these\nchallenges, biologically inspired event cameras offer a promising solution to\novercome the limitations of traditional RGB cameras. In this work, we rethink\nhuman activity recognition by combining the RGB and event cameras. The first\ncontribution is the proposed large-scale multi-modal RGB-Event human activity\nrecognition benchmark dataset, termed HARDVS 2.0, which bridges the dataset\ngaps. It contains 300 categories of everyday real-world actions with a total of\n107,646 paired videos covering various challenging scenarios. Inspired by the\nphysics-informed heat conduction model, we propose a novel multi-modal heat\nconduction operation framework for effective activity recognition, termed\nMMHCO-HAR. More in detail, given the RGB frames and event streams, we first\nextract the feature embeddings using a stem network. Then, multi-modal Heat\nConduction blocks are designed to fuse the dual features, the key module of\nwhich is the multi-modal Heat Conduction Operation layer. We integrate RGB and\nevent embeddings through a multi-modal DCT-IDCT layer while adaptively\nincorporating the thermal conductivity coefficient via FVEs into this module.\nAfter that, we propose an adaptive fusion module based on a policy routing\nstrategy for high-performance classification. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method consistently performs well, validating its\neffectiveness and robustness.

      "abstract": "Recently, the diffusion model has gained significant attention as one of the\nmost successful image generation models, which can generate high-quality images\nby iteratively sampling noise. However, recent studies have shown that\ndiffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, allowing attackers to\nenter input data containing triggers to activate the backdoor and generate\ntheir desired output. Existing backdoor attack methods primarily focused on\ntarget noise-to-image and text-to-image tasks, with limited work on backdoor\nattacks in image-to-image tasks. Furthermore, traditional backdoor attacks\noften rely on a single, conspicuous trigger to generate a fixed target image,\nlacking concealability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we\npropose a novel backdoor attack method called \"Parasite\" for image-to-image\ntasks in diffusion models, which not only is the first to leverage\nsteganography for triggers hiding, but also allows attackers to embed the\ntarget content as a backdoor trigger to achieve a more flexible attack.\n\"Parasite\" as a novel attack method effectively bypasses existing detection\nframeworks to execute backdoor attacks. In our experiments, \"Parasite\" achieved\na 0 percent backdoor detection rate against the mainstream defense frameworks.\nIn addition, in the ablation study, we discuss the influence of different\nhiding coefficients on the attack results.

      "abstract": "Video Question Answering (VideoQA) is a complex video-language task that\ndemands a sophisticated understanding of both visual content and temporal\ndynamics. Traditional Transformer-style architectures, while effective in\nintegrating multimodal data, often simplify temporal dynamics through\npositional encoding and fail to capture non-linear interactions within video\nsequences. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Trio Transformer (T3T), a\nnovel architecture that models time consistency and time variability. The T3T\nintegrates three key components: Temporal Smoothing (TS), Temporal Difference\n(TD), and Temporal Fusion (TF). The TS module employs Brownian Bridge for\ncapturing smooth, continuous temporal transitions, while the TD module\nidentifies and encodes significant temporal variations and abrupt changes\nwithin the video content. Subsequently, the TF module synthesizes these\ntemporal features with textual cues, facilitating a deeper contextual\nunderstanding and response accuracy. The efficacy of the T3T is demonstrated\nthrough extensive testing on multiple VideoQA benchmark datasets. Our results\nunderscore the importance of a nuanced approach to temporal modeling in\nimproving the accuracy and depth of video-based question answering.",
