      "abstract": "Most existing benchmarks for egocentric vision understanding focus primarily\non daytime scenarios, overlooking the low-light conditions that are inevitable\nin real-world applications. To investigate this gap, we present EgoNight, the\nfirst comprehensive benchmark for nighttime egocentric vision, with visual\nquestion answering (VQA) as the core task. A key feature of EgoNight is the\nintroduction of day-night aligned videos, which enhance night annotation\nquality using the daytime data and reveal clear performance gaps between\nlighting conditions. To achieve this, we collect both synthetic videos rendered\nby Blender and real-world recordings, ensuring that scenes and actions are\nvisually and temporally aligned. Leveraging these paired videos, we construct\nEgoNight-VQA, supported by a novel day-augmented night auto-labeling engine and\nrefinement through extensive human verification. Each QA pair is double-checked\nby annotators for reliability. In total, EgoNight-VQA contains 3658 QA pairs\nacross 90 videos, spanning 12 diverse QA types, with more than 300 hours of\nhuman work. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs) reveal substantial performance drops when transferring from day to\nnight, underscoring the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions.\nBeyond VQA, EgoNight also introduces two auxiliary tasks, day-night\ncorrespondence retrieval and egocentric depth estimation at night, that further\nexplore the boundaries of existing models. We believe EgoNight-VQA provides a\nstrong foundation for advancing application-driven egocentric vision research\nand for developing models that generalize across illumination domains. All the\ndata and code will be made available upon acceptance.",

      "abstract": "Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework\nfor enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs),\nparticularly in the context of test-time scaling (TTS). However, their\npotential for supervising LRMs on tabular reasoning domains remains\nunderexplored. Through detailed empirical analyses, we identify that existing\nPRMs, though widely adopted for supervising text-only reasoning steps, struggle\nwith table-specific operations such as sub-table retrieval and schema\ninteraction, leading to critical performance bottlenecks. To address this\nlimitation, we propose TaTToo, a novel table-grounded PRM framework that (i)\nreasons explicitly over tabular reasoning steps and (ii) integrates tool-based\nverification to provide precise reward supervision. Concretely, we first design\na scalable data curation pipeline that constructs over 60k high-quality\nstep-level annotations by integrating table verification rationales with\ntool-based executions. Building on the collected data, we train TaTToo with a\ndual-stage paradigm: cold-start supervised fine-tuning to capture tool-use\nreasoning patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with tool-grounded\nreward shaping to align our model with table-based verification. We provide a\ncomprehensive evaluation of the policy improvement induced by our newly\ndesigned PRM. Across 5 challenging tabular reasoning benchmarks covering\nnumerical reasoning, fact-checking, and data analysis, TaTToo improves\ndownstream policy LRMs by 30.9% at inference, surpasses strong PRM baselines\nsuch as Qwen-2.5-Math-PRM-72B with only 8B parameters, and demonstrates strong\ngeneralizability across diverse TTS strategies.",

      "abstract": "Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on external tools such as\nsearch engines to solve complex, multi-step problems, and reinforcement\nlearning (RL) has become a key paradigm for training them. However, the\ntrajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations\nin the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally\ndifferent answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient\nmethods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and\nformalize as cross-stratum bias-an \"apples-to-oranges\" comparison of\nheterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment\nand hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address\nthis, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage\nNormalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on\ntheir structural properties and computes advantages locally within each\nstratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true\npeers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields\nconditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains\nthe global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard\nnormalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To\nimprove practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly\nblend SAN with the global estimator. Extensive experiments on diverse\nsingle-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that\nStratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3\npoints, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more\neffective search policies. These results establish stratification as a\nprincipled remedy for structural heterogeneity in RL for LLM search agents.",

As dimensionality increases, the exploration space grows\nexponentially, while the manifold of meaningful skills remains limited.\nTherefore, semantic meaningfulness becomes essential to effectively guide\nexploration in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we present\nReference-Grounded Skill Discovery (RGSD), a novel algorithm that grounds skill\ndiscovery in a semantically meaningful latent space using reference data. RGSD\nfirst performs contrastive pretraining to embed motions on a unit hypersphere,\nclustering each reference trajectory into a distinct direction. This grounding\nenables skill discovery to simultaneously involve both imitation of reference\nbehaviors and the discovery of semantically related diverse behaviors. On a\nsimulated SMPL humanoid with 359-D observations and 69-D actions, RGSD learns\nstructured skills including walking, running, punching, and side stepping, and\nalso discovers related novel behaviors. In downstream control tasks, RGSD\noutperforms imitation-based skill acquisition baselines.

We introduce StarEmbed,\nthe first public benchmark for rigorous and standardized evaluation of\nstate-of-the-art TSFMs on stellar time series observations (``light curves'').\nWe benchmark on three scientifically-motivated downstream tasks: unsupervised\nclustering, supervised classification, and out-of-distribution source\ndetection. StarEmbed integrates a catalog of expert-vetted labels with\nmulti-variate light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility, yielding ~40k\nhand-labeled light curves spread across seven astrophysical classes. We\nevaluate the zero-shot representation capabilities of three TSFMs (MOIRAI,\nChronos, Chronos-Bolt) and a domain-specific transformer (Astromer) against\nhandcrafted feature extraction, the long-standing baseline in the astrophysics\nliterature. Our results demonstrate that these TSFMs, especially the Chronos\nmodels, which are trained on data completely unlike the astronomical\nobservations, can outperform established astrophysics-specific baselines in\nsome tasks and effectively generalize to entirely new data. In particular,\nTSFMs deliver state-of-the-art performance on our out-of-distribution source\ndetection benchmark.

      "abstract": "Auto-regressive speech-text models are typically pre-trained on a large\nnumber of interleaved sequences of text tokens and raw speech encoded as speech\ntokens using vector quantization. These models have demonstrated\nstate-of-the-art performance in speech-to-speech understanding and generation\nbenchmarks, together with promising scaling laws, primarily enabled by the\nrepresentational alignment between text and speech. Nevertheless, they suffer\nfrom shortcomings, partly owing to the disproportionately longer sequences of\nspeech tokens in contrast to textual tokens. This results in a large compute\nimbalance between modalities during pre-training as well as during inference,\nand a potential hindrance to effectively aligning speech and text, ultimately\ntranslating to several orders of magnitude slower scaling laws. We introduce\nthe Latent Speech-Text Transformer (LST), which makes pre-training speech-text\nmodels more data-efficient by dynamically and inexpensively aggregating speech\ntokens into latent speech patches. These patches serve as higher-level units\nthat can either align with corresponding textual units to aid capability\ntransfer or even encapsulate common speech sequences like silences to be more\ncompute-efficient. We show that LST outperforms vanilla approaches on\nspeech-to-speech as well as text-to-text benchmarks in both data- and\ncompute-controlled settings, the former indicating more effective\nrepresentational alignment and the latter indicating steeper scaling laws for\nspeech-text models. On HellaSwag story completion, LST achieves 6.5% absolute\ngain in speech accuracy under compute-controlled training and 5.3% under\ndata-controlled training, while also improving text performance.

      "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is starting to transform the research process as\nwe know it by automating the discovery of new solutions. Given a task, the\ntypical AI-driven approach is (i) to generate a set of diverse solutions, and\nthen (ii) to verify these solutions and select one that solves the problem.\nCrucially, this approach assumes the existence of a reliable verifier, i.e.,\none that can accurately determine whether a solution solves the given problem.\nWe argue that systems research, long focused on designing and evaluating new\nperformance-oriented algorithms, is particularly well-suited for AI-driven\nsolution discovery. This is because system performance problems naturally admit\nreliable verifiers: solutions are typically implemented in real systems or\nsimulators, and verification reduces to running these software artifacts\nagainst predefined workloads and measuring performance. We term this approach\nas AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS), which iteratively generates,\nevaluates, and refines solutions. Using penEvolve, an existing open-source ADRS\ninstance, we present case studies across diverse domains, including load\nbalancing for multi-region cloud scheduling, Mixture-of-Experts inference,\nLLM-based SQL queries, and transaction scheduling. In multiple instances, ADRS\ndiscovers algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art human designs (e.g.,\nachieving up to 5.0x runtime improvements or 50% cost reductions). We distill\nbest practices for guiding algorithm evolution, from prompt design to evaluator\nconstruction, for existing frameworks. We then discuss the broader implications\nfor the systems community: as AI assumes a central role in algorithm design, we\nargue that human researchers will increasingly focus on problem formulation and\nstrategic guidance.

      "abstract": "A critical challenge in modelling Heterogeneous-Agent Teams is training\nagents to collaborate with teammates whose policies are inaccessible or\nnon-stationary, such as humans. Traditional approaches rely on expensive\nhuman-in-the-loop data, which limits scalability. We propose using Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) as policy-agnostic human proxies to generate synthetic\ndata that mimics human decision-making. To evaluate this, we conduct three\nexperiments in a grid-world capture game inspired by Stag Hunt, a game theory\nparadigm that balances risk and reward. In Experiment 1, we compare decisions\nfrom 30 human participants and 2 expert judges with outputs from LLaMA 3.1 and\nMixtral 8x22B models. LLMs, prompted with game-state observations and reward\nstructures, align more closely with experts than participants, demonstrating\nconsistency in applying underlying decision criteria. Experiment 2 modifies\nprompts to induce risk-sensitive strategies (e.g. \"be risk averse\"). LLM\noutputs mirror human participants' variability, shifting between risk-averse\nand risk-seeking behaviours. Finally, Experiment 3 tests LLMs in a dynamic\ngrid-world where the LLM agents generate movement actions. LLMs produce\ntrajectories resembling human participants' paths. While LLMs cannot yet fully\nreplicate human adaptability, their prompt-guided diversity offers a scalable\nfoundation for simulating policy-agnostic teammates.",

In certain contexts (e.g., solving Sudoku puzzles),\nverifying responses can be substantially easier than generating them. This\nproperty, referred to as \\emph{asymmetric verification}, highlights the strong\npotential of test-time scaling (TTS). In this work, we study both sequential\nand parallel TTS of deep search agents, motivated by the intuition that\nverification in this setting is often much easier than generation. In\nexperiments, we first show that sequential scaling methods, such as budget\nforcing, can be effective initially but soon degrade performance.

This paper\npresents a systematic analysis revealing that CoT often degrades performance in\nvideo reasoning, generating verbose but misleading internal monologues, and\nleading to hallucinated visual details and overridden correct intuitions - a\nphenomenon we term \"visual thinking drift\". We explain this drift through a\nBayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual\nevidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models\nto storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning.

However, the results\nfor localization-related tasks are unsatisfactory: Precision and Recall are\nnear or below 50%, except for Flash in outlier identification (65.01%).\nFurthermore, the impact of chart design on performance appears to be a\nsecondary factor, but it is advisable to avoid scatterplots with wide aspect\nratios (16:9 and 21:9) or those colored randomly.

In this work, we first show that step-by-step reasoning\nis crucial for vision-language models (VLMs) to solve CAPTCHAs, which represent\nhigh-difficulty spatial reasoning tasks, and that current commercial\nvision-language models still struggle with such reasoning. In particular, we\nobserve that most commercial VLMs (e.g., Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.) fail to\neffectively solve CAPTCHAs and thus achieve low accuracy (around 21.9 percent).\nHowever, our findings indicate that requiring the model to perform step-by-step\nreasoning before generating the final coordinates can significantly enhance its\nsolving accuracy, underscoring the severity of the gap. To systematically study\nthis issue, we introduce CAPTCHA-X, the first real-world CAPTCHA benchmark with\nreasoning, covering seven categories of CAPTCHAs (such as Gobang, hCaptcha,\netc.) with step-by-step action solutions and grounding annotations.

However, as the landscape of\nreasoning models rapidly expands, a critical question remains: how can we\nsystematically compare and evaluate the test-time scaling capabilities across\ndifferent models? In this paper, we introduce ARISE (Adaptive Resolution-aware\nScaling Evaluation), a novel metric specifically designed to assess the\ntest-time scaling effectiveness of large reasoning models. Unlike existing\nevaluation approaches, ARISE incorporates two key innovations: (1) sample-level\nawareness that effectively penalizes negative scaling behaviors where increased\ncomputation leads to performance degradation, and (2) a dynamic sampling\nmechanism that mitigates the impact of accuracy fluctuations and token count\ninstability on the final assessment. We conduct comprehensive experiments\nevaluating state-of-the-art reasoning models across diverse domains including\nmathematical reasoning, code generation, and agentic tasks. Our results\ndemonstrate that ARISE provides a reliable and fine-grained measurement of\ntest-time scaling capabilities, revealing significant variations in scaling\nefficiency across models.

Empirical results demonstrated that the\nclassical MLP achieved near-optimal policy convergence with a mean return of\n498.7 +/- 3.2, maintaining stable equilibrium throughout training.

Noise\nrobustness analysis further revealed that the MLP policy deteriorated\ngracefully under Gaussian perturbations, while the VQC displayed higher\nsensitivity at equivalent noise levels.
