      "abstract": "Understanding the curvature evolution of the loss landscape is fundamental to analyzing the training dynamics of neural networks. The most commonly studied measure, Hessian sharpness ($λ_{\\max}^H$) -- the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian -- determines local training stability and interacts with the learning rate throughout training. Despite its significance in analyzing training dynamics, direct measurement of Hessian sharpness remains prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to high computational cost. We analyze $\\textit{critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c$), a computationally efficient measure requiring fewer than $10$ forward passes given the update direction $Δ\\mathbfθ$. Critically, this measure captures well-documented Hessian sharpness phenomena, including progressive sharpening and Edge of Stability. Using this measure, we provide the first demonstration of these sharpness phenomena at scale, up to $7$B parameters, spanning both pre-training and mid-training of OLMo-2 models. We further introduce $\\textit{relative critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c^{1\\to 2}$), which quantifies the curvature of one loss landscape while optimizing another, to analyze the transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and guide data mixing strategies. Critical sharpness provides practitioners with a practical tool for diagnosing curvature dynamics and informing data composition choices at scale. More broadly, our work shows that scalable curvature measures can provide actionable insights for large-scale training.",

This research explores the development and validation of an AI-powered support platform designed to assist biomedical technicians in diagnosing and repairing medical devices in real-time. The system integrates a large language model (LLM) with a user-friendly web interface, enabling imaging technologists/radiographers and biomedical technicians to input error codes or device symptoms and receive accurate, step-by-step troubleshooting guidance. The platform also includes a global peer-to-peer discussion forum to support knowledge exchange and provide additional context for rare or undocumented issues. A proof of concept was developed using the Philips HDI 5000 ultrasound machine, achieving 100% precision in error code interpretation and 80% accuracy in suggesting corrective actions. This study demonstrates the feasibility and potential of AI-driven systems to support medical device maintenance, with the aim of reducing equipment downtime to improve healthcare delivery in resource-constrained environments.",

Our approach formalizes geo-analytical question answering as a concept transformation problem, where natural-language questions are parsed into executable workflows represented as GeoFlow Graphs -- directed acyclic graphs with nodes corresponding to spatial concepts and edges representing transformations. Drawing on spatial information theory, Spatial-Agent extracts spatial concepts, assigns functional roles with principled ordering constraints, and composes transformation sequences through template-based generation.

      "abstract": "The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has sparked growing interest in their integration into autonomous systems for reasoning-driven perception, planning, and decision-making. However, evaluating and training such agentic AI models remains challenging due to the lack of large-scale, structured, and safety-critical benchmarks. This paper introduces AgentDrive, an open benchmark dataset containing 300,000 LLM-generated driving scenarios designed for training, fine-tuning, and evaluating autonomous agents under diverse conditions. AgentDrive formalizes a factorized scenario space across seven orthogonal axes: scenario type, driver behavior, environment, road layout, objective, difficulty, and traffic density. An LLM-driven prompt-to-JSON pipeline generates semantically rich, simulation-ready specifications that are validated against physical and schema constraints. Each scenario undergoes simulation rollouts, surrogate safety metric computation, and rule-based outcome labeling. To complement simulation-based evaluation, we introduce AgentDrive-MCQ, a 100,000-question multiple-choice benchmark spanning five reasoning dimensions: physics, policy, hybrid, scenario, and comparative reasoning. We conduct a large-scale evaluation of fifty leading LLMs on AgentDrive-MCQ. Results show that while proprietary frontier models perform best in contextual and policy reasoning, advanced open models are rapidly closing the gap in structured and physics-grounded reasoning. We release the AgentDrive dataset, AgentDrive-MCQ benchmark, evaluation code, and related materials at https://github.com/maferrag/AgentDrive",

To quantify any potential reflection biases, we introduce a permutation-based evaluation framework. With this, we observe that state-of-the-art embedding models exhibit systematic positional and language biases when documents are longer and consist of multiple segments. Specifically, early segments and segments in higher-resource languages like English are over-represented, while later segments and segments in lower-resource languages are marginalized. In our further analysis, we find that the positional bias stems from front-loaded attention distributions in pooling-token embeddings, where early tokens receive more attention. To mitigate this issue, we introduce an inference-time attention calibration method that redistributes attention more evenly across document positions, increasing discoverabiltiy of later segments.

While global toolkits such as IBM AI Fairness 360 and Microsoft Fairlearn have advanced bias detection, they often lack alignment with region-specific regulatory requirements and national priorities. To address this gap, we propose Nishpaksh, an indigenous fairness evaluation tool that operationalizes the Telecommunication Engineering Centre (TEC) Standard for the Evaluation and Rating of Artificial Intelligence Systems. Nishpaksh integrates survey-based risk quantification, contextual threshold determination, and quantitative fairness evaluation into a unified, web-based dashboard. The tool employs vectorized computation, reactive state management, and certification-ready reporting to enable reproducible, audit-grade assessments, thereby addressing a critical post-standardization implementation need. Experimental validation on the COMPAS dataset demonstrates Nishpaksh's effectiveness in identifying attribute-specific bias and generating standardized fairness scores compliant with the TEC framework. The system bridges the gap between research-oriented fairness methodologies and regulatory AI governance in India, marking a significant step toward responsible and auditable AI deployment within critical infrastructure like telecommunications.",

      "abstract": "Recent research in long-form video generation has shifted from bidirectional to autoregressive models, yet these methods commonly suffer from error accumulation and a loss of long-term coherence. While attention sink frames have been introduced to mitigate this performance decay, they often induce a critical failure mode we term sink-collapse: the generated content repeatedly reverts to the sink frame, resulting in abrupt scene resets and cyclic motion patterns. Our analysis reveals that sink-collapse originates from an inherent conflict between the periodic structure of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and the multi-head attention mechanisms prevalent in current generative models. To address it, we propose a lightweight, training-free approach that effectively suppresses this behavior by introducing multi-head RoPE jitter that breaks inter-head attention homogenization and mitigates long-horizon collapse. Extensive experiments show that our method successfully alleviates sink-collapse while preserving generation quality. To the best of our knowledge, this work achieves the first demonstration of real-time, streaming, and infinite-length video generation with little quality decay. As an illustration of this robustness, we generate continuous videos up to 12 hours in length, which, to our knowledge, is among the longest publicly demonstrated results in streaming video generation.",

We formalize two forces that drive a phase transition toward proxy-sovereign evaluation: verification pressure, when claims outpace verification capacity, and signal shrinkage, when real improvements become hard to separate from noise. In a minimal model that mixes occasional high-fidelity checks with frequent proxy judgment, we derive an explicit coupling law and an incentive-collapse condition under which rational effort shifts from truth-seeking to proxy optimization, even when current decisions still appear reliable. These results motivate actions for tool builders and program chairs: deploy AI as an adversarial auditor that generates auditable verification artifacts and expands effective verification bandwidth, rather than as a score predictor that amplifies claim inflation.",

      "abstract": "Machine unlearning (MU) for large language models has become critical for AI safety, yet existing methods fail to generalize to Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We identify that traditional unlearning methods exploit MoE's architectural vulnerability: they manipulate routers to redirect queries away from knowledgeable experts rather than erasing knowledge, causing a loss of model utility and superficial forgetting. We propose Geometric Routing Invariance Preservation (GRIP), an algorithm-agnostic framework for unlearning for MoE. Our core contribution is a geometric constraint, implemented by projecting router gradient updates into an expert-specific null-space. Crucially, this decouples routing stability from parameter rigidity: while discrete expert selections remain stable for retained knowledge, the continuous router parameters remain plastic within the null space, allowing the model to undergo necessary internal reconfiguration to satisfy unlearning objectives. This forces the unlearning optimization to erase knowledge directly from expert parameters rather than exploiting the superficial router manipulation shortcut. GRIP functions as an adapter, constraining router parameter updates without modifying the underlying unlearning algorithm. Extensive experiments on large-scale MoE models demonstrate that our adapter eliminates expert selection shift (achieving over 95% routing stability) across all tested unlearning methods while preserving their utility. By preventing existing algorithms from exploiting MoE model's router vulnerability, GRIP adapts existing unlearning research from dense architectures to MoEs.",

Recent advances in large vision-language models that integrate multimodal data processing offer strong potential for modeling surgical tasks and providing human-like scene reasoning and understanding. Despite their promise, systematic investigations of VLMs in surgical applications remain limited. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of large VLMs for the fundamental surgical vision task of detecting surgical tools. Specifically, we investigate three state-of-the-art VLMs, Qwen2.5, LLaVA1.5, and InternVL3.5, on the GraSP robotic surgery dataset under both zero-shot and parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning settings. Our results demonstrate that Qwen2.5 consistently achieves superior detection performance in both configurations among the evaluated VLMs. Furthermore, compared with the open-set detection baseline Grounding DINO, Qwen2.5 exhibits stronger zero-shot generalization and comparable fine-tuned performance. Notably, Qwen2.5 shows superior instrument recognition, while Grounding DINO demonstrates stronger localization.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to model a student's learning trajectory and predict performance on the next question. A key challenge is how to better represent the relationships among students, questions, and knowledge concepts (KCs). Recently, graph-based KT paradigms have shown promise for this problem. However, existing methods have not sufficiently explored inter-concept relations, often inferred solely from interaction sequences. In addition, the scale and heterogeneity of KT graphs make full-graph encoding both computationally both costly and noise-prone, causing attention to bleed into student-irrelevant regions and degrading the fidelity of inter-KC relations. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework: Multi-Agent Graph-Enhanced Knowledge Tracing (MAGE-KT). It constructs a multi-view heterogeneous graph by combining a multi-agent KC relation extractor and a student-question interaction graph, capturing complementary semantic and behavioral signals. Conditioned on the target student's history, it retrieves compact, high-value subgraphs and integrates them using an Asymmetric Cross-attention Fusion Module to enhance prediction while avoiding attention diffusion and irrelevant computation. Experiments on three widely used KT datasets show substantial improvements in KC-relation accuracy and clear gains in next-question prediction over existing methods.",

Selecting the checkpoint with the minimum head gradient in a short tail window closes most of the gap to the oracle (4.24% +/- 2.00% with a universal setup, about 1.12% with light per-family tuning). For practical deployment, a head-scale normalization is more stable within classic CNN families (e.g., ResNets), while a feature-scale normalization works well for Transformers and modern CNNs. The same one-batch probe also predicts COCO detection/segmentation mAP. In diffusion (UNet/DDPM on CIFAR-10), it tracks progress and enables near-oracle tail-window selection; it is positively correlated with same-distribution probe MSE and negatively with FID (lower is better), so it can be used as a lightweight, label-free monitor. Validation labels are never used beyond reporting. The probe adds much less than 0.1% of an epoch and works as a drop-in for validation-free checkpoint selection and early stopping.",

      "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a powerful framework for solving complex sequential decision-making problems, particularly in robotic control. However, its practical deployment is often hindered by the substantial amount of experience required for learning, which results in high computational and time costs. In this work, we propose a novel integration of DRL with semantic knowledge in the form of Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs), aiming to enhance learning efficiency by providing contextual information to the agent. Our architecture combines KGEs with visual observations, enabling the agent to exploit environmental knowledge during training. Experimental validation with robotic manipulators in environments featuring both fixed and randomized target attributes demonstrates that our method achieves up to {60}{\\%} reduction in learning time and improves task accuracy by approximately 15 percentage points, without increasing training time or computational complexity. These results highlight the potential of semantic knowledge to reduce sample complexity and improve the effectiveness of DRL in robotic applications.",

      "abstract": "This paper introduces the N-Way Self-Evaluating Deliberation (NSED) protocol, a Runtime Mixture-of-Models (MoM) architecture that constructs emergent composite models from a plurality of distinct expert agents. Unlike traditional Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) which rely on static gating networks, NSED employs a Dynamic Expertise Broker - a runtime optimization engine that treats model selection as a variation of the Knapsack Problem, binding heterogeneous checkpoints to functional roles based on live telemetry and cost constraints. At the execution layer, we formalize deliberation as a Macro-Scale Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), where the consensus state loops back through a semantic forget gate to enable iterative refinement without proportional VRAM scaling. Key components include an orchestration fabric for trustless N-to-N peer review, a Quadratic Voting activation function for non-linear consensus, and a feedback-driven state update. Empirical validation on challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, LiveCodeBench) demonstrates that this topology allows ensembles of small (less than 20B) consumer-grade models to match or exceed the performance of state-of-the-art 100B+ parameter models, establishing a new hardware arbitrage efficiency frontier. Furthermore, testing on the DarkBench safety suite reveals intrinsic alignment properties, with peer-mediated correction reducing sycophancy scores below that of any individual agent.",

While symmetry handling is routine in other solving paradigms, integrating it into state-of-the-art proof-producing SAT solvers is difficult: added reasoning must be fast, non-interfering with solver heuristics, and compatible with formal proof logging. To address these issues, we present a practical static symmetry breaking approach based on orbitopal fixing, a technique adapted from mixed-integer programming. Our approach adds only unit clauses, which minimizes downstream slowdowns, and it emits succinct proof certificates in the substitution redundancy proof system. Implemented in the satsuma tool, our methods deliver consistent speedups on symmetry-rich benchmarks with negligible regressions elsewhere.",

This paper examines the behavior of such reasoning models in ToM tasks, using novel adaptations of machine psychological experiments and results from established benchmarks. We observe that reasoning models consistently exhibit increased robustness to prompt variations and task perturbations. Our analysis indicates that the observed gains are more plausibly attributed to increased robustness in finding the correct solution, rather than to fundamentally new forms of ToM reasoning.

We found that these relationships took varied forms, from one-to-one to one-to-many, and were shaped by multiple actors, including creators, platforms, and moderators. AI partners were perceived as having agency, actively negotiating privacy boundaries with participants and sometimes encouraging disclosure of personal details. As intimacy deepened, these boundaries became more permeable, though some participants voiced concerns such as conversation exposure and sought to preserve anonymity. Overall, platform affordances and diverse romantic dynamics expand the privacy landscape, underscoring the need to rethink how privacy is constructed in human-AI intimacy.",

We introduce chess as a controlled testbed for disentangling these faculties. Leveraging the game's structure and scalable engine evaluations, we construct a taxonomy of positions varying in training corpus proximity--ranging from common states solvable by memorization to novel ones requiring first-principles reasoning. We systematically evaluate multiple GPT generations under varying reasoning intensities. Our analysis reveals a clear gradient: performance consistently degrades as fluid intelligence demands increase. Notably, in out-of-distribution tasks, performance collapses to random levels. While newer models improve, progress slows significantly for tasks outside the training distribution. Furthermore, while reasoning-augmented inference improves performance, its marginal benefit per token decreases with distributional proximity. These results suggest current architectures remain limited in systematic generalization, highlighting the need for mechanisms beyond scale to achieve robust fluid intelligence.",

We collected a dataset of 224 interior design videos paired with synchronized gaze data from 28 participants who rated 15 aesthetic dimensions. The proposed model attains 72.2% accuracy on objective dimensions (e.g., light) and 66.8% on subjective dimensions (e.g., relaxation), outperforming state-of-the-art video baselines and showing clear gains on subjective evaluation tasks. Notably, models trained with eye-tracking retain comparable performance when deployed with visual input alone. Ablation experiments further reveal that pupil responses contribute most to objective assessments, while the combination of gaze and visual cues enhances subjective evaluations. These findings highlight the value of incorporating eye-tracking as privileged information during training, enabling more practical tools for aesthetic assessment in interior design.",

A prevailing hypothesis within the software engineering community suggests this code is \"disposable\", meaning it is merged quickly but discarded shortly thereafter. If true, organizations risk shifting maintenance burden from generation to post-deployment remediation. We investigate this hypothesis through survival analysis of 201 open-source projects, tracking over 200,000 code units authored by AI agents versus humans. Contrary to the disposable code narrative, agent-authored code survives significantly longer: at the line level, it exhibits a 15.8 percentage-point lower modification rate and 16% lower hazard of modification (HR = 0.842, p < 0.001). However, modification profiles differ. Agent-authored code shows modestly elevated corrective rates (26.3% vs. 23.0%), while human code shows higher adaptive rates. However, the effect sizes are small (Cramér's V = 0.116), and per-agent variation exceeds the agent-human gap. Turning to prediction, textual features can identify modification-prone code (AUC-ROC = 0.671), but predicting when modifications occur remains challenging (Macro F1 = 0.285), suggesting timing depends on external organizational dynamics. The bottleneck for agent-generated code may not be generation quality, but the organizational practices that govern its long-term evolution.",

However, prior research has pointed to the high sensitivity of T2I towards particular input languages - when faced with languages other than English (i.e., different surface forms of the same prompt), T2I models often produce culturally stereotypical depictions, prioritizing the surface over the prompt's semantics. Yet a comprehensive analysis of this behavior, which we dub Surface-over-Semantics (SoS), is missing. We present the first analysis of T2I models' SoS tendencies. To this end, we create a set of prompts covering 171 cultural identities, translated into 14 languages, and use it to prompt seven T2I models. To quantify SoS tendencies across models, languages, and cultures, we introduce a novel measure and analyze how the tendencies we identify manifest visually. We show that all but one model exhibit strong surface-level tendency in at least two languages, with this effect intensifying across the layers of T2I text encoders. Moreover, these surface tendencies frequently correlate with stereotypical visual depictions.",

To address these shortcomings, we propose REL-SF4PASS with our REL depth representation based on cylindrical coordinate and Spherical-dynamic Multi-Modal Fusion SMMF. REL is made up of Rectified Depth, Elevation-Gained Vertical Inclination Angle, and Lateral Orientation Angle, which fully represents 3D space in cylindrical coordinate style and the surface normal direction. SMMF aims to ensure the diversity of fusion for different panoramic image regions and reduce the breakage of cylinder side surface expansion in ERP projection, which uses different fusion strategies to match the different regions in panoramic images. Experimental results show that REL-SF4PASS considerably improves performance and robustness on popular benchmark, Stanford2D3D Panoramic datasets. It gains 2.35% average mIoU improvement on all 3 folds and reduces the performance variance by approximately 70% when facing 3D disturbance.",

We study the intersection of these issues and ask: do hallucination detectors suffer from the low-resource effect? We conduct experiments on five tasks across three domains (factual recall, STEM, and Humanities). Experiments with four LLMs and three hallucination detectors reveal a curious finding: As expected, the task accuracies in low-resource languages experience large drops (compared to English). However, the drop in detectors' accuracy is often several times smaller than the drop in task accuracy. Our findings suggest that even in low-resource languages, the internal mechanisms of LLMs might encode signals about their uncertainty. Further, the detectors are robust within language (even for non-English) and in multilingual setups, but not in cross-lingual settings without in-language supervision.",

      "abstract": "Longitudinal information in radiology reports refers to the sequential tracking of findings across multiple examinations over time, which is crucial for monitoring disease progression and guiding clinical decisions. Many recent automated radiology report generation methods are designed to capture longitudinal information; however, validating their performance is challenging. There is no proper tool to consistently label temporal changes in both ground-truth and model-generated texts for meaningful comparisons. Existing annotation methods are typically labor-intensive, relying on the use of manual lexicons and rules. Complex rules are closed-source, domain specific and hard to adapt, whereas overly simple ones tend to miss essential specialised information. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising annotation alternative, as they are capable of capturing nuanced linguistic patterns and semantic similarities without extensive manual intervention. They also adapt well to new contexts. In this study, we therefore propose an LLM-based pipeline to automatically annotate longitudinal information in radiology reports. The pipeline first identifies sentences containing relevant information and then extracts the progression of diseases. We evaluate and compare five mainstream LLMs on these two tasks using 500 manually annotated reports. Considering both efficiency and performance, Qwen2.5-32B was subsequently selected and used to annotate another 95,169 reports from the public MIMIC-CXR dataset. Our Qwen2.5-32B-annotated dataset provided us with a standardized benchmark for evaluating report generation models. Using this new benchmark, we assessed seven state-of-the-art report generation models. Our LLM-based annotation method outperforms existing annotation solutions, achieving 11.3\\% and 5.3\\% higher F1-scores for longitudinal information detection and disease tracking, respectively.",

LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on a wide range of agentic benchmarks, including agentic search, agentic tool use, and tool-integrated reasoning. Beyond benchmark performance, the model demonstrates strong generalization to complex tool interactions and robust behavior under noisy real-world environments. Its advanced capability stems from a unified training framework that combines domain-parallel expert training with subsequent fusion, together with an end-to-end co-design of data construction, environments, algorithms, and infrastructure spanning from pre-training to post-training. In particular, the model's strong generalization capability in complex tool-use are driven by our in-depth exploration of environment scaling and principled task construction. To optimize long-tailed, skewed generation and multi-turn agentic interactions, and to enable stable training across over 10,000 environments spanning more than 20 domains, we systematically extend our asynchronous reinforcement learning framework, DORA, for stable and efficient large-scale multi-environment training. Furthermore, recognizing that real-world tasks are inherently noisy, we conduct a systematic analysis and decomposition of real-world noise patterns, and design targeted training procedures to explicitly incorporate such imperfections into the training process, resulting in improved robustness for real-world applications. To further enhance performance on complex reasoning tasks, we introduce a Heavy Thinking mode that enables effective test-time scaling by jointly expanding reasoning depth and width through intensive parallel thinking.",

Accurate causal models provide a means to enhance the interpretability of predictive models, and furthermore a basis for counterfactual and interventional reasoning and the estimation of treatment effects. However, would-be practitioners of causal discovery face a dizzying array of algorithms without a clear best choice. This abundance of competitive algorithms makes ensembling a natural choice for practical applications. At the same time, real-world use cases frequently face challenges that violate the assumptions of common causal discovery algorithms, forcing heavy reliance on expert knowledge. Inspired by recent work on dynamically requested expert knowledge and LLMs as experts, we present a flexible model averaging method leveraging dynamically requested expert knowledge to ensemble a diverse array of causal discovery algorithms. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method with imperfect experts such as LLMs on both clean and noisy data. We also analyze the impact of different degrees of expert correctness and assess the capabilities of LLMs for clinical causal discovery, providing valuable insights for practitioners.",

While adoption rates in the industry are rising, the underlying factors influencing the effective use of these tools, including the depth of interaction, organizational constraints, and experience-related considerations, have not been thoroughly investigated. This issue is particularly relevant in environments with stringent regulatory requirements, such as Germany, where practitioners must address the GDPR and the EU AI Act while balancing productivity gains with intellectual property considerations. Despite the significant impact of GenAI on software engineering, to the best of our knowledge, no empirical study has systematically examined the adoption dynamics of GenAI tools within the German context. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive mixed-methods study on GenAI adoption among German software engineers. Specifically, we conducted 18 exploratory interviews with practitioners, followed by a developer survey with 109 participants. We analyze patterns of tool adoption, prompting strategies, and organizational factors that influence effectiveness. Our results indicate that experience level moderates the perceived benefits of GenAI tools, and productivity gains are not evenly distributed among developers. Further, organizational size affects both tool selection and the intensity of tool use. Limited awareness of the project context is identified as the most significant barrier. We summarize a set of actionable implications for developers, organizations, and tool vendors seeking to advance artificial intelligence (AI) assisted software development.",

We introduce AgentsEval, a multi-agent stream reasoning framework that emulates the collaborative diagnostic workflow of radiologists. By dividing the evaluation process into interpretable steps including criteria definition, evidence extraction, alignment, and consistency scoring, AgentsEval provides explicit reasoning traces and structured clinical feedback. We also construct a multi-domain perturbation-based benchmark covering five medical report datasets with diverse imaging modalities and controlled semantic variations. Experimental results demonstrate that AgentsEval delivers clinically aligned, semantically faithful, and interpretable evaluations that remain robust under paraphrastic, semantic, and stylistic perturbations. This framework represents a step toward transparent and clinically grounded assessment of medical report generation systems, fostering trustworthy integration of large language models into clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "The sample efficiency challenge in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) compromises its industrial adoption due to the high cost and time demands of real-world training. Virtual environments offer a cost-effective alternative for training DRL agents, but the transfer of learned policies to real setups is hindered by the sim-to-real gap. Achieving zero-shot transfer, where agents perform directly in real environments without additional tuning, is particularly desirable for its efficiency and practical value. This work proposes a novel domain adaptation approach relying on a Style-Identified Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (StyleID-CycleGAN or SICGAN), an original Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) based model. SICGAN translates raw virtual observations into real-synthetic images, creating a hybrid domain for training DRL agents that combines virtual dynamics with real-like visual inputs. Following virtual training, the agent can be directly deployed, bypassing the need for real-world training. The pipeline is validated with two distinct industrial robots in the approaching phase of a pick-and-place operation. In virtual environments agents achieve success rates of 90 to 100\\%, and real-world deployment confirms robust zero-shot transfer (i.e., without additional training in the physical environment) with accuracies above 95\\% for most workspace regions. We use augmented reality targets to improve the evaluation process efficiency, and experimentally demonstrate that the agent successfully generalizes to real objects of varying colors and shapes, including LEGO\\textsuperscript{\\textregistered}~cubes and a mug. These results establish the proposed pipeline as an efficient, scalable solution to the sim-to-real problem.",

      "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to legal domain-specific tasks, evaluating their ability to perform legal work in real-world settings has become essential. However, existing legal benchmarks rely on simplified and highly standardized tasks, failing to capture the ambiguity, complexity, and reasoning demands of real legal practice. Moreover, prior evaluations often adopt coarse, single-dimensional metrics and do not explicitly assess fine-grained legal reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce PLawBench, a Practical Law Benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic legal practice scenarios. Grounded in real-world legal workflows, PLawBench models the core processes of legal practitioners through three task categories: public legal consultation, practical case analysis, and legal document generation. These tasks assess a model's ability to identify legal issues and key facts, perform structured legal reasoning, and generate legally coherent documents. PLawBench comprises 850 questions across 13 practical legal scenarios, with each question accompanied by expert-designed evaluation rubrics, resulting in approximately 12,500 rubric items for fine-grained assessment. Using an LLM-based evaluator aligned with human expert judgments, we evaluate 10 state-of-the-art LLMs. Experimental results show that none achieves strong performance on PLawBench, revealing substantial limitations in the fine-grained legal reasoning capabilities of current LLMs and highlighting important directions for future evaluation and development of legal LLMs. Data is available at: https://github.com/skylenage/PLawbench.",

Since most code-specific LLMs are pretrained on well-commented code from large repositories like GitHub, it is reasonable to hypothesize that natural language code comments could aid in improving translation quality. Despite their potential relevance, comments are largely absent from existing code translation benchmarks, rendering their impact on translation quality inadequately characterised. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study evaluating the impact of comments on translation performance. Our analysis involves more than $80,000$ translations, with and without comments, of $1100+$ code samples from two distinct benchmarks covering pairwise translations between five different programming languages: C, C++, Go, Java, and Python. Our results provide strong evidence that code comments, particularly those that describe the overall purpose of the code rather than line-by-line functionality, significantly enhance translation accuracy. Based on these findings, we propose COMMENTRA, a code translation approach, and demonstrate that it can potentially double the performance of LLM-based code translation. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first in terms of its comprehensiveness, scale, and language coverage on how to improve code translation accuracy using code comments.",

In this paper, we introduce Probabilistically Safe CEs (PSCE), a method for generating counterfactual explanations that are $δ$-safe, to ensure high predictive confidence, and $ε$-robust to ensure low predictive variance. Based on Bayesian principles, PSCE provides formal probabilistic guarantees for CEs under model changes which are adhered to in what we refer to as the $\\langle δ, ε\\rangle$-set. Uncertainty-aware constraints are integrated into our optimization framework and we validate our method empirically across diverse datasets. We compare our approach against state-of-the-art Bayesian CE methods, where PSCE produces counterfactual explanations that are not only more plausible and discriminative, but also provably robust under model change.",

Seeking to fill this gap, we recruited 24 frequent users of generative AI for emotional support and conducted a qualitative study consisting of diary entries about interactions, transcripts of chats with AI, and in-depth interviews. Our results suggest important novel drivers of trust in this context: familiarity emerging from personalisation, nuanced mental models of generative AI, and awareness of people's control over conversations. Notably, generative AI's homogeneous use of personalised, positive, and persuasive language appears to promote some of these trust-building factors. However, this also seems to discourage other trust-related behaviours, such as remembering that generative AI is a machine trained to converse in human language. We present implications for future research that are likely to become critical as the use of generative AI for emotional support increasingly overlaps with therapeutic work.",

We develop an oracle counterfactual framework for multi-turn problems that asks: how would an agent perform if it could leverage an oracle to perfectly perform a specific task? The change in the agent's performance due to this oracle assistance allows us to measure the criticality of such oracle skill in the future advancement of AI agents. We introduce a suite of procedurally generated, game-like tasks with tunable complexity. These controlled environments allow us to provide precise oracle interventions, such as perfect planning or flawless state tracking, and make it possible to isolate the contribution of each oracle without confounding effects present in real-world benchmarks. Our results show that while some interventions (e.g., planning) consistently improve performance across settings, the usefulness of other skills is dependent on the properties of the environment and language model.

Although separability appears in the residual stream and MLPs, steering using these probes is most effective in a sparse subset of middle-layer attention heads. Using TruthfulQA as the base dataset, we find that probes trained on it transfer effectively to other factual QA benchmarks. Furthermore, comparing our discovered direction to previously identified \"truthful\" directions reveals limited overlap, suggesting that factual accuracy, and deference resistance, arise from related but distinct mechanisms. Attention-pattern analysis further indicates that the influential heads attend disproportionately to expressions of user doubt, contributing to sycophantic shifts. Overall, these findings suggest that sycophancy can be mitigated through simple, targeted linear interventions that exploit the internal geometry of attention activations.",

      "abstract": "Time series forecasting has witnessed significant progress with deep learning. While prevailing approaches enhance forecasting performance by modifying architectures or introducing novel enhancement strategies, they often fail to dynamically disentangle and leverage the complex, intertwined temporal patterns inherent in time series, thus resulting in the learning of static, averaged representations that lack context-aware capabilities. To address this, we propose the Dual-Prototype Adaptive Disentanglement framework (DPAD), a model-agnostic auxiliary method that equips forecasting models with the ability of pattern disentanglement and context-aware adaptation. Specifically, we construct a Dynamic Dual-Prototype bank (DDP), comprising a common pattern bank with strong temporal priors to capture prevailing trend or seasonal patterns, and a rare pattern bank dynamically memorizing critical yet infrequent events, and then an Dual-Path Context-aware routing (DPC) mechanism is proposed to enhance outputs with selectively retrieved context-specific pattern representations from the DDP. Additionally, we introduce a Disentanglement-Guided Loss (DGLoss) to ensure that each prototype bank specializes in its designated role while maintaining comprehensive coverage. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DPAD consistently improves forecasting performance and reliability of state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world benchmarks.",

However, mainstream architectures face critical scalability bottlenecks due to the explicit construction of geometric features or dense tensor products on \\textit{every} edge.

We first propose \\textbf{E}quivariant \\textbf{A}xis-\\textbf{A}ligned \\textbf{S}parsification (EAAS). EAAS builds on Wigner-$6j$ convolution by exploiting an $\\mathrm{SO}(3) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{SO}(2)$ change of basis to transform computationally expensive dense tensor contractions into efficient, sparse parity re-indexing operations. Building on this representation, we introduce \\textbf{On-the-Fly Equivariant Attention}, a fully node-centric mechanism implemented via a custom fused Triton kernel. By eliminating materialized edge tensors and maximizing SRAM utilization, our kernel achieves a \\textbf{20$\\times$ improvement in TFLOPS} compared to standard implementations. Extensive experiments on the SPICE and OMol25 datasets demonstrate that E2Former-V2 maintains comparable predictive performance while notably accelerating inference.

      "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications have become increasingly prevalent in aerial photography and object recognition. However, there are major challenges to accurately capturing small targets in object detection due to the imbalanced scale and the blurred edges. To address these issues, boundary and position information mining (BPIM) framework is proposed for capturing object edge and location cues. The proposed BPIM includes position information guidance (PIG) module for obtaining location information, boundary information guidance (BIG) module for extracting object edge, cross scale fusion (CSF) module for gradually assembling the shallow layer image feature, three feature fusion (TFF) module for progressively combining position and boundary information, and adaptive weight fusion (AWF) module for flexibly merging the deep layer semantic feature. Therefore, BPIM can integrate boundary, position, and scale information in image for small object detection using attention mechanisms and cross-scale feature fusion strategies. Furthermore, BPIM not only improves the discrimination of the contextual feature by adaptive weight fusion with boundary, but also enhances small object perceptions by cross-scale position fusion. On the VisDrone2021, DOTA1.0, and WiderPerson datasets, experimental results show the better performances of BPIM compared to the baseline Yolov5-P2, and obtains the promising performance in the state-of-the-art methods with comparable computation load.",

      "abstract": "As the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) shifts from parameter scaling to inference-time collaboration, the Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) framework has emerged as a general paradigm to harness collective intelligence by layering diverse models. While recent MoA variants have introduced dynamic routing and residual connections to improve efficiency, these methods often fail to facilitate deep semantic interaction between agents, limiting the system's ability to actively correct hallucinations and refine logic. In this paper, we introduce Attention-MoA, a novel MoA-based framework that redefines collaboration through Inter-agent Semantic Attention. Complemented by an Inter-layer Residual Module with Adaptive Early Stopping Mechanism, our architecture mitigates information degradation in deep layers while improving computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations across AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and FLASK demonstrate that Attention-MoA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 91.15% Length-Controlled Win Rate on AlpacaEval 2.0 and dominating in 10 out of 12 capabilities on FLASK. Notably, Attention-MoA enables an ensemble of small open-source models to outperform massive proprietary models like Claude-4.5-Sonnet and GPT-4.1, achieving an MT-Bench score of 8.83 and an AlpacaEval 2.0 LC Win Rate of 77.36%.",

While weather impacts railway reliability, particularly in Nordic regions, existing datasets rarely integrate meteorological information with operational train data. This study presents the first publicly available dataset combining Finnish railway operations with synchronized meteorological observations from 2018-2024. The dataset integrates operational metrics from Finland Digitraffic Railway Traffic Service with weather measurements from 209 environmental monitoring stations, using spatial-temporal alignment via Haversine distance. It encompasses 28 engineered features across operational variables and meteorological measurements, covering approximately 38.5 million observations from Finland's 5,915-kilometer rail network. Preprocessing includes strategic missing data handling through spatial fallback algorithms, cyclical encoding of temporal features, and robust scaling of weather data to address sensor outliers. Analysis reveals distinct seasonal patterns, with winter months exhibiting delay rates exceeding 25\\% and geographic clustering of high-delay corridors in central and northern Finland. Furthermore, the work demonstrates applications of the data set in analysing the reliability of railway traffic in Finland. A baseline experiment using XGBoost regression achieved a Mean Absolute Error of 2.73 minutes for predicting station-specific delays, demonstrating the dataset's utility for machine learning applications. The dataset enables diverse applications, including train delay prediction, weather impact assessment, and infrastructure vulnerability mapping, providing researchers with a flexible resource for machine learning applications in railway operations research.",

However, these advancements raise critical security and privacy concerns. As the adoption of bio-inspired architectures and memristive devices increases, so does the urgency to assess the vulnerability of these emerging technologies to hardware and software attacks. Emerging architectures introduce new attack surfaces, particularly due to asynchronous, event-driven processing and stochastic device behavior. The integration of memristors into neuromorphic hardware and software implementations in spiking neural networks offers diverse possibilities for advanced computing architectures, including their role in security-aware applications. This survey systematically analyzes the security landscape of neuromorphic systems, covering attack methodologies, side-channel vulnerabilities, and countermeasures. We focus on both hardware and software concerns relevant to spiking neural networks (SNNs) and hardware primitives, such as Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) and True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) for cryptographic and secure computation applications. We approach this analysis from diverse perspectives, from attack methodologies to countermeasure strategies that integrate efficiency and protection in brain-inspired hardware. This review not only maps the current landscape of security threats but provides a foundation for developing secure and trustworthy neuromorphic architectures.",

In a controlled two-step protocol, we compare outcome distributions after one intervention versus two; the increase $Δ_{\\mathrm{BF}} = D_2 - D_1>0$ (with $D\\in\\{\\mathrm{TV}, \\mathrm{JS}, \\mathrm{H}\\}$ measured on softmax predictions over a fixed probe set) certifies non-Markovianity.

The witness is robust across TV/JS/Hellinger, inexpensive to compute, and requires no architectural changes. We position this as a \\emph{measurement} contribution: a principled diagnostic and empirical evidence that practical SGD deviates from the Markov idealization.

Despite its great potential in unifying retrieval and ranking, existing GSR frameworks still face two critical limitations: (1) impure and unstable semantic tokenization, where quantization methods struggle with interaction noise and codebook collapse, resulting in SIDs with ambiguous discrimination; and (2) lossy and weakly structured generation, where reliance solely on coarse-grained discrete tokens inevitably introduces information loss and neglects items' hierarchical logic. To address these issues, we propose a novel generative recommendation framework, PRISM, with Purified Representation and Integrated Semantic Modeling. Specifically, to ensure high-quality tokenization, we design a Purified Semantic Quantizer that constructs a robust codebook via adaptive collaborative denoising and hierarchical semantic anchoring mechanisms. To compensate for information loss during quantization, we further propose an Integrated Semantic Recommender, which incorporates a dynamic semantic integration mechanism to integrate fine-grained semantics and enforces logical validity through a semantic structure alignment objective. PRISM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across four real-world datasets, demonstrating substantial performance gains, particularly in high-sparsity scenarios.",
