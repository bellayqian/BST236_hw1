      "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models have demonstrated how\nchain-of-thought (CoT) and reinforcement learning (RL) can improve performance.\nHowever, applying such reasoning strategies to the visual generation domain\nremains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present T2I-R1, a novel\nreasoning-enhanced text-to-image generation model, powered by RL with a\nbi-level CoT reasoning process. Specifically, we identify two levels of CoT\nthat can be utilized to enhance different stages of generation: (1) the\nsemantic-level CoT for high-level planning of the prompt and (2) the\ntoken-level CoT for low-level pixel processing during patch-by-patch\ngeneration. To better coordinate these two levels of CoT, we introduce\nBiCoT-GRPO with an ensemble of generation rewards, which seamlessly optimizes\nboth generation CoTs within the same training step. By applying our reasoning\nstrategies to the baseline model, Janus-Pro, we achieve superior performance\nwith 13% improvement on T2I-CompBench and 19% improvement on the WISE\nbenchmark, even surpassing the state-of-the-art model FLUX.1.

      "abstract": "Recently, natural language has been the primary medium for human-robot\ninteraction. However, its inherent lack of spatial precision for robotic\ncontrol introduces challenges such as ambiguity and verbosity. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce the Robotic Visual Instruction (RoVI), a novel\nparadigm to guide robotic tasks through an object-centric, hand-drawn symbolic\nrepresentation. RoVI effectively encodes spatial-temporal information into\nhuman-interpretable visual instructions through 2D sketches, utilizing arrows,\ncircles, colors, and numbers to direct 3D robotic manipulation. To enable\nrobots to understand RoVI better and generate precise actions based on RoVI, we\npresent Visual Instruction Embodied Workflow (VIEW), a pipeline formulated for\nRoVI-conditioned policies. This approach leverages Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs) to interpret RoVI inputs, decode spatial and temporal constraints from\n2D pixel space via keypoint extraction, and then transform them into executable\n3D action sequences. We additionally curate a specialized dataset of 15K\ninstances to fine-tune small VLMs for edge deployment, enabling them to\neffectively learn RoVI capabilities. Our approach is rigorously validated\nacross 11 novel tasks in both real and simulated environments, demonstrating\nsignificant generalization capability. Notably, VIEW achieves an 87.5% success\nrate in real-world scenarios involving unseen tasks that feature multi-step\nactions, with disturbances, and trajectory-following requirements.

      "abstract": "Urban air pollution remains a pressing global concern, particularly in\ndensely populated and traffic-intensive metropolitan areas like Delhi, where\nexposure to harmful pollutants severely impacts public health. Delhi, being one\nof the most polluted cities globally, experiences chronic air quality issues\ndue to vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and construction dust, which\nexacerbate its already fragile atmospheric conditions. Traditional pollution\nmitigation strategies, such as static air purifying installations, often fail\nto maximize their impact due to suboptimal placement and limited adaptability\nto dynamic urban environments. This study presents a novel deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL) framework to optimize the placement of air purification booths\nto improve the air quality index (AQI) in the city of Delhi. We employ Proximal\nPolicy Optimization (PPO), a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm,\nto iteratively learn and identify high-impact locations based on multiple\nspatial and environmental factors, including population density, traffic\npatterns, industrial influence, and green space constraints. Our approach is\nbenchmarked against conventional placement strategies, including random and\ngreedy AQI-based methods, using multi-dimensional performance evaluation\nmetrics such as AQI improvement, spatial coverage, population and traffic\nimpact, and spatial entropy. Experimental results demonstrate that the RL-based\napproach outperforms baseline methods by achieving a balanced and effective\ndistribution of air purification infrastructure. Notably, the DRL framework\nachieves an optimal trade-off between AQI reduction and high-coverage\ndeployment, ensuring equitable environmental benefits across urban regions.

Leveraging LLMs as critique models to achieve automated supervision is\na promising solution. In this work, we focus on studying and enhancing the math\ncritique ability of LLMs. Current LLM critics provide critiques that are too\nshallow and superficial on each step, leading to low judgment accuracy and\nstruggling to offer sufficient feedback for the LLM generator to correct\nmistakes. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel and effective two-stage\nframework to develop LLM critics that are capable of deliberately critiquing on\neach reasoning step of math solutions. In the first stage, we utilize\nQwen2.5-72B-Instruct to generate 4.5K long-form critiques as seed data for\nsupervised fine-tuning. Each seed critique consists of deliberate step-wise\ncritiques that includes multi-perspective verifications as well as in-depth\ncritiques of initial critiques for each reasoning step. Then, we perform\nreinforcement learning on the fine-tuned model with either existing\nhuman-labeled data from PRM800K or our automatically annotated data obtained\nvia Monte Carlo sampling-based correctness estimation, to further incentivize\nits critique ability. Our developed critique model built on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct\nnot only significantly outperforms existing LLM critics (including the\nsame-sized DeepSeek-R1-distill models and GPT-4o) on various error\nidentification benchmarks, but also more effectively helps the LLM generator\nrefine erroneous steps through more detailed feedback.",

These failures to\ngeneralize from fine-tuning can hinder practical application of these models.\nHowever, language models' in-context learning shows different inductive biases,\nand can generalize better in some of these cases. Here, we explore these\ndifferences in generalization between in-context- and fine-tuning-based\nlearning. To do so, we constructed several novel datasets to evaluate and\nimprove models' ability to generalize from finetuning data. The datasets are\nconstructed to isolate the knowledge in the dataset from that in pretraining,\nto create clean tests of generalization. We expose pretrained large models to\ncontrolled subsets of the information in these datasets -- either in context,\nor through fine-tuning -- and evaluate their performance on test sets that\nrequire various types of generalization. We find overall that in data-matched\nsettings, in-context learning can generalize more flexibly than fine-tuning\n(though we also find some qualifications of prior findings, such as cases when\nfine-tuning can generalize to reversals embedded in a larger structure of\nknowledge). We build on these findings to propose a method to enable improved\ngeneralization from fine-tuning: adding in-context inferences to finetuning\ndata.

Ensuring that the model accurately distinguishes\nmessages from each role -- a concept we call \\emph{role separation} -- is\ncrucial for consistent multi-role behavior. Although recent work often targets\nstate-of-the-art prompt injection defenses, it remains unclear whether such\nmethods truly teach LLMs to differentiate roles or merely memorize known\ntriggers. In this paper, we examine \\emph{role-separation learning}: the\nprocess of teaching LLMs to robustly distinguish system and user tokens.\nThrough a \\emph{simple, controlled experimental framework}, we find that\nfine-tuned models often rely on two proxies for role identification: (1) task\ntype exploitation, and (2) proximity to begin-of-text. Although data\naugmentation can partially mitigate these shortcuts, it generally leads to\niterative patching rather than a deeper fix. To address this, we propose\nreinforcing \\emph{invariant signals} that mark role boundaries by adjusting\ntoken-wise cues in the model's input encoding. In particular, manipulating\nposition IDs helps the model learn clearer distinctions and reduces reliance on\nsuperficial proxies.

Pre-training on large datasets have been shown to help models\nlearn transferable representations and adapt with minimal labeled data. This\nbehavior is especially valuable in medical imaging, where annotations are often\nscarce. However, applying this paradigm to multimodal medical data introduces a\nchallenge: most existing approaches assume that all imaging modalities are\navailable during both pre-training and fine-tuning.

This\nallows fine-tuning on any subset of modalities without requiring architectural\nchanges, while still benefiting from a model pre-trained on the full set of\nmodalities.

      "abstract": "Interpretable insights from predictive models remain critical in\nbio-statistics, particularly when assessing causality, where classical\nstatistical and machine learning methods often provide inherent clarity. While\nNeural Networks (NNs) offer powerful capabilities for modeling complex\nbiological data, their traditional \"black-box\" nature presents challenges for\nvalidation and trust in high-stakes health applications. Recent advances in\nMechanistic Interpretability (MI) aim to decipher the internal computations\nlearned by these networks. This work investigates the application of MI\ntechniques to NNs within the context of causal inference for bio-statistics.\n  We demonstrate that MI tools can be leveraged to: (1) probe and validate the\ninternal representations learned by NNs, such as those estimating nuisance\nfunctions in frameworks like Targeted Minimum Loss-based Estimation (TMLE); (2)\ndiscover and visualize the distinct computational pathways employed by the\nnetwork to process different types of inputs, potentially revealing how\nconfounders and treatments are handled; and (3) provide methodologies for\ncomparing the learned mechanisms and extracted insights across statistical,\nmachine learning, and NN models, fostering a deeper understanding of their\nrespective strengths and weaknesses for causal bio-statistical analysis.",

Although domain adaptation offers a\nsolution, privacy concerns restrict access to training data in many real-world\nscenarios. This restriction has spurred interest in Test-Time Adaptation (TTA),\nwhich adapts models using only unlabeled test data. However, current TTA\nmethods still face practical challenges: (1) a primary focus on instance-wise\nalignment, overlooking CORrelation ALignment (CORAL) due to missing source\ncorrelations; (2) complex backpropagation operations for model updating,\nresulting in overhead computation and (3) domain forgetting.\n  To address these challenges, we provide a theoretical analysis to investigate\nthe feasibility of Test-time Correlation Alignment (TCA), demonstrating that\ncorrelation alignment between high-certainty instances and test instances can\nenhance test performances with a theoretical guarantee. Based on this, we\npropose two simple yet effective algorithms: LinearTCA and LinearTCA+.\nLinearTCA applies a simple linear transformation to achieve both instance and\ncorrelation alignment without additional model updates, while LinearTCA+ serves\nas a plug-and-play module that can easily boost existing TTA methods. Extensive\nexperiments validate our theoretical insights and show that TCA methods\nsignificantly outperforms baselines across various tasks, benchmarks and\nbackbones.

It receives textual task instruction and GUI description to generate\nexecutable actions (\\emph{e.g.}, click) and operation boxes step by step.\nTraining a GUI agent mainly involves grounding and planning stages, in which\nthe GUI grounding focuses on finding the execution coordinates according to the\ntask, while the planning stage aims to predict the next action based on\nhistorical actions. However, previous work suffers from the limitations of\ninsufficient training data for GUI grounding, as well as the ignorance of\nbacktracking historical behaviors for GUI planning. To handle the above\nchallenges, we propose ScaleTrack, a training framework by scaling grounding\nand backtracking planning for automated GUI agents. We carefully collected GUI\nsamples of different synthesis criterions from a wide range of sources, and\nunified them into the same template for training GUI grounding models.\nMoreover, we design a novel training strategy that predicts the next action\nfrom the current GUI image, while also backtracking the historical actions that\nled to the GUI image. In this way, ScaleTrack explains the correspondence\nbetween GUI images and actions, which effectively describes the evolution rules\nof the GUI environment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of ScaleTrack. Data and code will be available at url.",

This study presents the first comprehensive human-centered\nanalysis of anonymized pathological speech, using a structured perceptual\nprotocol involving ten native and non-native German listeners with diverse\nlinguistic, clinical, and technical backgrounds. Listeners evaluated\nanonymized-original utterance pairs from 180 speakers spanning Cleft Lip and\nPalate, Dysarthria, Dysglossia, Dysphonia, and age-matched healthy controls.\nSpeech was anonymized using state-of-the-art automatic methods (equal error\nrates in the range of 30-40%). Listeners completed Turing-style discrimination\nand quality rating tasks under zero-shot (single-exposure) and few-shot\n(repeated-exposure) conditions. Discrimination accuracy was high overall (91%\nzero-shot; 93% few-shot), but varied by disorder (repeated-measures ANOVA:\np=0.007), ranging from 96% (Dysarthria) to 86% (Dysphonia). Anonymization\nconsistently reduced perceived quality (from 83% to 59%, p<0.001), with\npathology-specific degradation patterns (one-way ANOVA: p=0.005). Native\nlisteners rated original speech slightly higher than non-native listeners\n(Delta=4%, p=0.199), but this difference nearly disappeared after anonymization\n(Delta=1%, p=0.724). No significant gender-based bias was observed. Critically,\nhuman perceptual outcomes did not correlate with automatic privacy or clinical\nutility metrics. These results underscore the need for listener-informed,\ndisorder- and context-specific anonymization strategies that preserve privacy\nwhile maintaining interpretability, communicative functions, and diagnostic\nutility, especially for vulnerable populations such as children.",

This becomes even more critical\nduring anomaly conditions like the epidemic outbreak, during which couriers'\ndelivery timely rate will decline markedly and fluctuates significantly.\nExisting studies pay less attention to the logistics scenario. Moreover, many\nworks focusing on prediction tasks in anomaly scenarios fail to explicitly\nmodel abnormal events, e.g., treating external factors equally with other\nfeatures, resulting in great information loss. Further, since some anomalous\nevents occur infrequently, traditional data-driven methods perform poorly in\nthese scenarios. To deal with them, we propose a deep spatial-temporal\nattention model, named DeepSTA. To be specific, to avoid information loss, we\ndesign an anomaly spatio-temporal learning module that employs a recurrent\nneural network to model incident information. Additionally, we utilize Node2vec\nto model correlations between road districts, and adopt graph neural networks\nand long short-term memory to capture the spatial-temporal dependencies of\ncouriers. To tackle the issue of insufficient training data in abnormal\ncircumstances, we propose an anomaly pattern attention module that adopts a\nmemory network for couriers' anomaly feature patterns storage via attention\nmechanisms. The experiments on real-world logistics datasets during the\nCOVID-19 outbreak in 2022 show the model outperforms the best baselines by\n12.11% in MAE and 13.71% in MSE, demonstrating its superior performance over\nmultiple competitive baselines.",

      "abstract": "Accurately estimating package delivery time is essential to the logistics\nindustry, which enables reasonable work allocation and on-time service\nguarantee. This becomes even more necessary in mixed logistics scenarios where\ncouriers handle a high volume of delivery and a smaller number of pickup\nsimultaneously. However, most of the related works treat the pickup and\ndelivery patterns on couriers' decision behavior equally, neglecting that the\npickup has a greater impact on couriers' decision-making compared to the\ndelivery due to its tighter time constraints. In such context, we have three\nmain challenges: 1) multiple spatiotemporal factors are intricately\ninterconnected, significantly affecting couriers' delivery behavior; 2) pickups\nhave stricter time requirements but are limited in number, making it\nchallenging to model their effects on couriers' delivery process; 3) couriers'\nspatial mobility patterns are critical determinants of their delivery behavior,\nbut have been insufficiently explored. To deal with these, we propose TransPDT,\na Transformer-based multi-task package delivery time prediction model. We first\nemploy the Transformer encoder architecture to capture the spatio-temporal\ndependencies of couriers' historical travel routes and pending package sets.\nThen we design the pattern memory to learn the patterns of pickup in the\nimbalanced dataset via attention mechanism. We also set the route prediction as\nan auxiliary task of delivery time prediction, and incorporate the prior\ncourier spatial movement regularities in prediction. Extensive experiments on\nreal industry-scale datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. A\nsystem based on TransPDT is deployed internally in JD Logistics to track more\nthan 2000 couriers handling hundreds of thousands of packages per day in\nBeijing.",

      "abstract": "The proliferation of end devices has led to a distributed computing paradigm,\nwherein on-device machine learning models continuously process diverse data\ngenerated by these devices. The dynamic nature of this data, characterized by\ncontinuous changes or data drift, poses significant challenges for on-device\nmodels. To address this issue, continual learning (CL) is proposed, enabling\nmachine learning models to incrementally update their knowledge and mitigate\ncatastrophic forgetting. However, the traditional centralized approach to CL is\nunsuitable for end devices due to privacy and data volume concerns. In this\ncontext, federated continual learning (FCL) emerges as a promising solution,\npreserving user data locally while enhancing models through collaborative\nupdates. Aiming at the challenges of limited storage resources for CL, poor\nautonomy in task shift detection, and difficulty in coping with new adversarial\ntasks in FCL scenario, we propose a novel FCL framework named SacFL. SacFL\nemploys an Encoder-Decoder architecture to separate task-robust and\ntask-sensitive components, significantly reducing storage demands by retaining\nlightweight task-sensitive components for resource-constrained end devices.\nMoreover, $\\rm{SacFL}$ leverages contrastive learning to introduce an\nautonomous data shift detection mechanism, enabling it to discern whether a new\ntask has emerged and whether it is a benign task. This capability ultimately\nallows the device to autonomously trigger CL or attack defense strategy without\nadditional information, which is more practical for end devices. Comprehensive\nexperiments conducted on multiple text and image datasets, such as Cifar100 and\nTHUCNews, have validated the effectiveness of $\\rm{SacFL}$ in both\nclass-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios.
