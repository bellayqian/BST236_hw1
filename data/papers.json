      "abstract": "Generalist robots that can perform a range of different tasks in open-world\nsettings must be able to not only reason about the steps needed to accomplish\ntheir goals, but also process complex instructions, prompts, and even feedback\nduring task execution. Intricate instructions (e.g., \"Could you make me a\nvegetarian sandwich?\" or \"I don't like that one\") require not just the ability\nto physically perform the individual steps, but the ability to situate complex\ncommands and feedback in the physical world. In this work, we describe a system\nthat uses vision-language models in a hierarchical structure, first reasoning\nover complex prompts and user feedback to deduce the most appropriate next step\nto fulfill the task, and then performing that step with low-level actions. In\ncontrast to direct instruction following methods that can fulfill simple\ncommands (\"pick up the cup\"), our system can reason through complex prompts and\nincorporate situated feedback during task execution (\"that's not trash\"). We\nevaluate our system across three robotic platforms, including single-arm,\ndual-arm, and dual-arm mobile robots, demonstrating its ability to handle tasks\nsuch as cleaning messy tables, making sandwiches, and grocery shopping.",

      "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of localized updates to large language\nmodels (LLMs), specifically in the context of knowledge editing - a task aimed\nat incorporating or modifying specific facts without altering broader model\ncapabilities. We first show that across different post-training interventions\nlike continuous pre-training, full fine-tuning and LORA-based fine-tuning, the\nFrobenius norm of the updated matrices always increases. This increasing norm\nis especially detrimental for localized knowledge editing, where only a subset\nof matrices are updated in a model . We reveal a consistent phenomenon across\nvarious editing techniques, including fine-tuning, hypernetwork-based\napproaches, and locate-and-edit methods: the norm of the updated matrix\ninvariably increases with successive updates. Such growth disrupts model\nbalance, particularly when isolated matrices are updated while the rest of the\nmodel remains static, leading to potential instability and degradation of\ndownstream performance. Upon deeper investigations of the intermediate\nactivation vectors, we find that the norm of internal activations decreases and\nis accompanied by shifts in the subspaces occupied by these activations, which\nshows that these activation vectors now occupy completely different regions in\nthe representation space compared to the unedited model. With our paper, we\nhighlight the technical challenges with continuous and localized sequential\nknowledge editing and their implications for maintaining model stability and\nutility.",

We take the position that it is both legally\nand technically feasible to extract the scientific knowledge in scholarly\ntexts. Current methods, like text embeddings, fail to reliably preserve factual\ncontent, and simple paraphrasing may not be legally sound. We urge the\ncommunity to adopt a new idea: convert scholarly documents into Knowledge Units\nusing LLMs. These units use structured data capturing entities, attributes and\nrelationships without stylistic content. We provide evidence that Knowledge\nUnits: (1) form a legally defensible framework for sharing knowledge from\ncopyrighted research texts, based on legal analyses of German copyright law and\nU.S. Fair Use doctrine, and (2) preserve most (~95%) factual knowledge from\noriginal text, measured by MCQ performance on facts from the original\ncopyrighted text across four research domains. Freeing scientific knowledge\nfrom copyright promises transformative benefits for scientific research and\neducation by allowing language models to reuse important facts from copyrighted\ntext.

Personal AI assistants today are often located on\nultra-small devices such as smartwatches, which have limited screen space. The\nverbosity of LLM-generated explanations, however, makes it challenging to\ndeliver glanceable LLM explanations on such ultra-small devices. To address\nthis, we explored 1) spatially structuring an LLM's explanation text using\ndefined contextual components during prompting and 2) presenting temporally\nadaptive explanations to users based on confidence levels. We conducted a user\nstudy to understand how these approaches impacted user experiences when\ninteracting with LLM recommendations and explanations on ultra-small devices.\nThe results showed that structured explanations reduced users' time to action\nand cognitive load when reading an explanation. Always-on structured\nexplanations increased users' acceptance of AI recommendations. However, users\nwere less satisfied with structured explanations compared to unstructured ones\ndue to their lack of sufficient, readable details. Additionally, adaptively\npresenting structured explanations was less effective at improving user\nperceptions of the AI compared to the always-on structured explanations.\nTogether with users' interview feedback, the results led to design implications\nto be mindful of when personalizing the content and timing of LLM explanations\nthat are displayed on ultra-small devices.",

However, obtaining high-quality multi-modal MRI in a\nclinical setting is difficult due to factors such as time constraints, high\ncosts, and patient movement artifacts. To overcome this difficulty, there is\nincreasing interest in developing generative models that can synthesize missing\ntarget modality images from the available source ones. Therefore, we design a\ngenerative model for missing MRI that integrates multi-modal contrastive\nlearning with a focus on critical tumor regions. Specifically, we integrate\nmulti-modal contrastive learning, tailored for multiple source modalities, and\nenhance its effectiveness by selecting features based on entropy during the\ncontrastive learning process. Additionally, our network not only generates the\nmissing target modality images but also predicts segmentation outputs,\nsimultaneously. This approach improves the generator's capability to precisely\ngenerate tumor regions, ultimately improving performance in downstream\nsegmentation tasks. By leveraging a combination of contrastive, segmentation,\nand additional self-representation losses, our model effectively reflects\ntarget-specific information and generate high-quality target images.\nConsequently, our results in the Brain MR Image Synthesis challenge demonstrate\nthat the proposed model excelled in generating the missing modality.",

Resting-state fMRI, a non-invasive tool for\ncapturing brain connectivity patterns, aids in early ASD diagnosis and\ndifferentiation from typical controls (TC). However, previous methods, which\nrely on either mean time series or full 4D data, are limited by a lack of\nspatial information or by high computational costs. This underscores the need\nfor an efficient solution that preserves both spatial and temporal information.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel, simple, and efficient spatial-temporal-omics\nlearning framework designed to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features\nfrom fMRI for ASD classification. Our approach addresses these limitations by\nutilizing 3D time-domain derivatives as the spatial-temporal inter-voxel omics,\nwhich preserve full spatial resolution while capturing diverse statistical\ncharacteristics of the time series at each voxel. Meanwhile, functional\nconnectivity features serve as the spatial-temporal inter-regional omics,\ncapturing correlations across brain regions. Extensive experiments and ablation\nstudies on the ABIDE dataset demonstrate that our framework significantly\noutperforms previous methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

In this paper, we aim to unify the embedding and OT-based methods\nin a mutually beneficial manner and propose a joint optimal transport and\nembedding framework for network alignment named JOENA. For one thing (OT for\nembedding), through a simple yet effective transformation, the noise-reduced OT\nmapping serves as an adaptive sampling strategy directly modeling all\ncross-network node pairs for robust embedding learning.For another (embedding\nfor OT), on top of the learned embeddings, the OT cost can be gradually trained\nin an end-to-end fashion, which further enhances the alignment quality. With a\nunified objective, the mutual benefits of both methods can be achieved by an\nalternating optimization schema with guaranteed convergence. Extensive\nexperiments on real-world networks validate the effectiveness and scalability\nof JOENA, achieving up to 16% improvement in MRR and 20x speedup compared with\nthe state-of-the-art alignment methods.",

In response to these limitations, current\nresearch has employed deep-learning models to efficiently predict molecular and\nsolid Hamiltonians, with roto-translational symmetries encoded in their neural\nnetworks.

It is easier for convolutional neural networks(CNNs) to visually\nrecognize and learn fault features by converting the complicated\none-dimensional (1D) vibrational signals into two-dimensional (2D) images with\nsimple textures. However, the existing representation methods for encoding 1D\nsignals as images have two main problems, including complicated computation and\nlow separability. Meanwhile, the existing 2D-CNN fault diagnosis methods taking\n2D images as the only inputs still suffer from the inevitable information loss\nbecause of the conversion process.

Second, aiming at the\ninformation loss problem of existing CNN models with the single input of\nconverted images, a double-branch EGR-based CNN, called EGR-Net, is proposed to\nlearn faulty features from both raw signal feature maps and their corresponding\nEGRs.

      "abstract": "Test-time computing approaches, which leverage additional computational\nresources during inference, have been proven effective in enhancing large\nlanguage model performance. This work introduces a novel, linearly scaling\napproach, TestNUC, that improves test-time predictions by leveraging the local\nconsistency of neighboring unlabeled data-it classifies an input instance by\nconsidering not only the model's prediction on that instance but also on\nneighboring unlabeled instances. We evaluate TestNUC across eight diverse\ndatasets, spanning intent classification, topic mining, domain discovery, and\nemotion detection, demonstrating its consistent superiority over baseline\nmethods such as standard prompting and self-consistency. Furthermore, TestNUC\ncan be seamlessly integrated with existing test-time computing approaches,\nsubstantially boosting their performance. Our analysis reveals that TestNUC\nscales effectively with increasing amounts of unlabeled data and performs\nrobustly across different embedding models, making it practical for real-world\napplications.

      "abstract": "Social categories and stereotypes are embedded in language and can introduce\ndata bias into Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite safeguards, these biases\noften persist in model behavior, potentially leading to representational harm\nin outputs. While sociolinguistic research provides valuable insights into the\nformation of stereotypes, NLP approaches for stereotype detection rarely draw\non this foundation and often lack objectivity, precision, and interpretability.\nTo fill this gap, in this work we propose a new approach that detects and\nquantifies the linguistic indicators of stereotypes in a sentence. We derive\nlinguistic indicators from the Social Category and Stereotype Communication\n(SCSC) framework which indicate strong social category formulation and\nstereotyping in language, and use them to build a categorization scheme. To\nautomate this approach, we instruct different LLMs using in-context learning to\napply the approach to a sentence, where the LLM examines the linguistic\nproperties and provides a basis for a fine-grained assessment. Based on an\nempirical evaluation of the importance of different linguistic indicators, we\nlearn a scoring function that measures the linguistic indicators of a\nstereotype. Our annotations of stereotyped sentences show that these indicators\nare present in these sentences and explain the strength of a stereotype. In\nterms of model performance, our results show that the models generally perform\nwell in detecting and classifying linguistic indicators of category labels used\nto denote a category, but sometimes struggle to correctly evaluate the\nassociated behaviors and characteristics. Using more few-shot examples within\nthe prompts, significantly improves performance. Model performance increases\nwith size, as Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct and GPT-4 achieve comparable results that\nsurpass those of Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct, GPT-4-mini and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.",

We present a multi-faceted\nevaluation framework that measures not only performance but also fairness,\nunintended effects, and adaptability across varying levels of preference\ndivergence. Through extensive experiments comparing eight personalization\nmethods across three preference datasets, we demonstrate that performance\ndifferences between methods could reach 36% when users strongly disagree, and\npersonalization can introduce up to 20% safety misalignment.

We\ndevelop simulations of agents collaborating on shared objectives to study these\nsecurity risks and security trade-offs. We focus on scenarios where an attacker\ncompromises one agent, using it to steer the entire system toward misaligned\noutcomes by corrupting other agents. In this context, we observe infectious\nmalicious prompts - the multi-hop spreading of malicious instructions. To\nmitigate this risk, we evaluated several strategies: two \"vaccination\"\napproaches that insert false memories of safely handling malicious input into\nthe agents' memory stream, and two versions of a generic safety instruction\nstrategy. While these defenses reduce the spread and fulfillment of malicious\ninstructions in our experiments, they tend to decrease collaboration capability\nin the agent network.

The system employs a two-phase generation of a robot-oriented knowledge\nbase, ensuring reusability and compositional reasoning, as well as a three-step\nplanning procedure that handles temporal dependencies, resource constraints,\nand parallel task execution via mixed-integer linear programming. The final\nplan is converted into a Behaviour Tree for direct use in ROS2. We tested the\nframework in multi-robot assembly tasks within a block world and an\narch-building scenario. Results demonstrate that LLMs can produce accurate\nknowledge bases with modest human feedback, while Prolog guarantees formal\ncorrectness and explainability.

      "abstract": "Much of the success of multi-agent debates depends on carefully choosing the\nright parameters. Among them, the decision-making protocol stands out.\nSystematic comparison of decision protocols is difficult because studies alter\nmultiple discussion parameters beyond the protocol. So far, it has been largely\nunknown how decision-making addresses the challenges of different tasks. This\nwork systematically evaluates the impact of seven decision protocols (e.g.,\nmajority voting, unanimity consensus). We change only one variable at a time\n(i.e., decision protocol) to analyze how different methods affect the\ncollaboration between agents and test different protocols on knowledge (MMLU,\nMMLU-Pro, GPQA) and reasoning datasets (StrategyQA, MuSR, SQuAD 2.0). Our\nresults show that voting protocols improve performance by 13.2% in reasoning\ntasks and consensus protocols by 2.8% in knowledge tasks over the other\ndecision protocol. Increasing the number of agents improves performance, while\nmore discussion rounds before voting reduces it. To improve decision-making by\nincreasing answer diversity, we propose two new methods, All-Agents Drafting\n(AAD) and Collective Improvement (CI). Our methods improve task performance by\nup to 3.3% with AAD and up to 7.4% with CI. This work demonstrates the\nimportance of decision-making in multi-agent debates beyond scaling.",

However,\nin contrast to this need for confidentiality, the current standard training\nparadigm for machine learning-based retrosynthesis gathers reaction data from\nmultiple sources into one single edge to train prediction models. This paradigm\nposes considerable privacy risks as it necessitates broad data availability\nacross organizational boundaries and frequent data transmission between\nentities, potentially exposing proprietary information to unauthorized access\nor interception during storage and transfer. In the present study, we introduce\nthe chemical knowledge-informed framework (CKIF), a privacy-preserving approach\nfor learning retrosynthesis models. CKIF enables distributed training across\nmultiple chemical organizations without compromising the confidentiality of\nproprietary reaction data. Instead of gathering raw reaction data, CKIF learns\nretrosynthesis models through iterative, chemical knowledge-informed\naggregation of model parameters. In particular, the chemical properties of\npredicted reactants are leveraged to quantitatively assess the observable\nbehaviors of individual models, which in turn determines the adaptive weights\nused for model aggregation. On a variety of reaction datasets, CKIF outperforms\nseveral strong baselines by a clear margin (e.g., ~20% performance improvement\nover FedAvg on USPTO-50K), showing its feasibility and superiority to stimulate\nfurther research on privacy-preserving retrosynthesis.",
