      "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning\nwith Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are the main RL paradigms used in LLM\npost-training, each offering distinct advantages. However, RLHF struggles with\ninterpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that\nusually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus\non correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary\nFlexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven\npreferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward\nmodels to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness.\nRLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g.\naccuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language\nfeedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as\nan entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary\nprinciple). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform\nBradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on\nRM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24,\n2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time\nto customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry\nmodels. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to\nalign Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the\nperformance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of\nMT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost).",

We introduce SAGE\n(Semantic Alignment & Generalization Evaluation), a rigorous benchmark designed\nto assess both embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories:\nHuman Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity,\nClustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness. Unlike existing benchmarks\nthat focus on isolated capabilities, SAGE evaluates semantic understanding\nthrough adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and nuanced human\njudgment tasks across 30+ datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation of 9 embedding\nmodels and classical metrics reveals significant performance gaps, with no\nsingle approach excelling across all dimensions. For instance, while\nstate-of-the-art embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominate\nin aligning with human preferences (0.682 vs. 0.591 for the best classical\nmetric), they are significantly outperformed by classical metrics on\ninformation sensitivity tasks, where Jaccard Similarity achieves a score of\n0.905 compared to the top embedding score of 0.794. SAGE further uncovers\ncritical trade-offs: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small achieves the highest\nclustering performance (0.483) but demonstrates extreme brittleness with the\nlowest robustness score (0.011).

Recent work has shown that, under certain conditions,\nportions of the training set can be reconstructed directly from model\nparameters. Some of these methods exploit implicit bias toward margin\nmaximization, suggesting that properties often regarded as beneficial for\ngeneralization may actually compromise privacy. Yet despite striking empirical\ndemonstrations, the reliability of these attacks remains poorly understood and\nlacks a solid theoretical foundation. In this work, we take a complementary\nperspective: rather than designing stronger attacks, we analyze the inherent\nweaknesses and limitations of existing reconstruction methods and identify\nconditions under which they fail. We rigorously prove that, without\nincorporating prior knowledge about the data, there exist infinitely many\nalternative solutions that may lie arbitrarily far from the true training set,\nrendering reconstruction fundamentally unreliable. Empirically, we further\ndemonstrate that exact duplication of training examples occurs only by chance.\nOur results refine the theoretical understanding of when training set leakage\nis possible and offer new insights into mitigating reconstruction attacks.\nRemarkably, we demonstrate that networks trained more extensively, and\ntherefore satisfying implicit bias conditions more strongly -- are, in fact,\nless susceptible to reconstruction attacks, reconciling privacy with the need\nfor strong generalization in this setting.",

Unlike clipping, PSPO preserves gradient\nsignal, while interpolation toward the old policy creates a soft trust region\nthat discourages large, destabilising updates, with formal guarantees.\n  We instantiate PSPO within GRPO (GR-PSPO) and fine-tune Qwen2.5-0.5B and\nQwen2.5-1.5B on GSM8K, evaluating on GSM8K test and the cross-dataset\ngeneralisation on SVAMP, ASDiv, and MATH-500.

      "abstract": "The field of vision-language understanding has been actively researched in\nrecent years, thanks to the development of Large Language Models~(LLMs).\nHowever, it still needs help with problems requiring multi-step reasoning, even\nfor very simple questions. Recent studies adopt LLMs to tackle this problem by\niteratively generating sub-questions and answers. However, there are\ndisadvantages such as 1) the fine-grained visual contents of images are not\navailable using LLMs that cannot read visual information, 2) internal\nmechanisms are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce by using black-box LLMs.\nTo solve these problems, we propose the SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP,\nwhich improves inference performance by generating image-aware informative\nsub-questions and sub-answers iteratively. The SQ-InstructBLIP, which consists\nof a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that share the same architecture.\nQuestioner and Answerer generate sub-questions and sub-answers to help infer\nthe main-question, and Reasoner performs reasoning on the main-question\nconsidering the generated sub-question information. Our experiments show that\nthe proposed method SQ-InstructBLIP, which uses the generated sub-questions as\nadditional information when solving the VQA task, performs more accurate\nreasoning than the previous works.",

Recent research has demonstrated significantly improved\nperformance through fine-tuning LLMs with code review data. However, compared\nto human reviewers who often simultaneously analyze multiple dimensions of code\nreview to better identify issues, the full potential of these methods is\nhampered by the limited or vague information used to fine-tune the models.

Crucially, discovery hinges on understanding the\nmodel output, which is often a multi-dimensional latent embedding rather than a\nwell-defined target. While explainability for supervised learning usually seeks\nto uncover how input features are used to predict a target, its unsupervised\ncounterpart should relate input features to the structure of the learned latent\nspace. Adaptations of supervised model explainability for unsupervised learning\nprovide either single-sample or dataset-wide summary explanations. However,\nwithout automated strategies of relating similar samples to one another guided\nby their latent proximity, explanations remain either too fine-grained or too\nreductive to be meaningful. This is especially relevant for manifold learning\nmethods that produce no mapping function, leaving us only with the relative\nspatial organization of their embeddings. We introduce Locality-Aware Variable\nAssociations (LAVA), a post-hoc model-agnostic method designed to explain local\nembedding organization through its relationship with the input features. To\nachieve this, LAVA represents the latent space as a series of localities\n(neighborhoods) described in terms of correlations between the original\nfeatures, and then reveals reoccurring patterns of correlations across the\nentire latent space.

Going beyond an\naccuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning\nprocess, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies\nreasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training\nprocess (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains).\nSpecifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of\ngranularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs,\nand the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to\nindividual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning\ntrajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories,\nwhereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens\n(about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay\nrates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality\ndistributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates\nreasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it\nacross many steps.

      "abstract": "The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators\n(LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation\nframeworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1)\nScore-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform\nhigher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity\nInconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and\nequivalence contradictions (A=B=C\\neq A). We argue that these issues come from\ninformation loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during\npairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that\naddresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1)\ndistribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from\ndiscrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise\nscoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity\nviolations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also\nformalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and\ndemonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with\nLlama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces\nScore-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise\nTransitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining\nhigher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of\nevaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both\ntheoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment.\nThe framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model\narchitectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without\nrequiring additional training or human annotations.

In this paper, we introduce an alternative paradigm,\nLearning from Cross-Modal Instructions, where robots are shaped by\ndemonstrations in the form of rough annotations, which can contain free-form\ntext labels, and are used in lieu of physical motion. We introduce the\nCrossInstruct framework, which integrates cross-modal instructions as examples\ninto the context input to a foundational vision-language model (VLM). The VLM\nthen iteratively queries a smaller, fine-tuned model, and synthesizes the\ndesired motion over multiple 2D views. These are then subsequently fused into a\ncoherent distribution over 3D motion trajectories in the robot's workspace. By\nincorporating the reasoning of the large VLM with a fine-grained pointing\nmodel, CrossInstruct produces executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond\nthe environment of in the limited set of instruction examples. We then\nintroduce a downstream reinforcement learning pipeline that leverages\nCrossInstruct outputs to efficiently learn policies to complete fine-grained\ntasks. We rigorously evaluate CrossInstruct on benchmark simulation tasks and\nreal hardware, demonstrating effectiveness without additional fine-tuning and\nproviding a strong initialization for policies subsequently refined via\nreinforcement learning.",

Our core innovation is the generation of\ngraphs with persistent semantic communities, ensuring conceptual consistency\nwhile allowing fine-grained control over structural properties like homophily\nand degree distributions.

Benchmarking a\nwide range of architectures -- from GNNs to graph transformers and topological\narchitectures -- reveals that strong transductive performance is a poor\npredictor of inductive generalization. Furthermore, we find that robustness to\ndistribution shift is highly sensitive not only to model architecture choice\nbut also to the initial graph regime (e.g., high vs. low homophily). Beyond\nbenchmarking, GraphUniverse's flexibility and scalability can facilitate the\ndevelopment of robust and truly generalizable architectures -- including\nnext-generation graph foundation models.

Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the\ndecision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches\nor misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained\nsignificant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance\ncompared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against\nadversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks,\nparticularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI\nclassification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing\nrealistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs.\nnon-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT)\ntechnique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring\nnaturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of\nadversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification\nmodels. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary\nperson classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack\nsuccess rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97%\n(facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and\nfacebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%.

While the naive kernels\n(e.g., FlashAttention) are typically preferred in training and prefill for\ntheir computational efficiency, existing decoding kernels (e.g., FlashMLA) rely\non the absorb method to minimize HBM bandwidth usage.

As a result, TyphoonMLA improves the throughput of attention\ncalculations in MLA architectures by up to 3x and 3.24x on NPU and GPUs, with\nonly a 3% overhead in HBM size.",
