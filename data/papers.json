      "abstract": "Sampling from diffusion models involves a slow iterative process that hinders\ntheir practical deployment, especially for interactive applications. To\naccelerate generation speed, recent approaches distill a multi-step diffusion\nmodel into a single-step student generator via variational score distillation,\nwhich matches the distribution of samples generated by the student to the\nteacher's distribution. However, these approaches use the reverse\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for distribution matching which is known to be\nmode seeking. In this paper, we generalize the distribution matching approach\nusing a novel $f$-divergence minimization framework, termed $f$-distill, that\ncovers different divergences with different trade-offs in terms of mode\ncoverage and training variance. We derive the gradient of the $f$-divergence\nbetween the teacher and student distributions and show that it is expressed as\nthe product of their score differences and a weighting function determined by\ntheir density ratio. This weighting function naturally emphasizes samples with\nhigher density in the teacher distribution, when using a less mode-seeking\ndivergence. We observe that the popular variational score distillation approach\nusing the reverse-KL divergence is a special case within our framework.\nEmpirically, we demonstrate that alternative $f$-divergences, such as\nforward-KL and Jensen-Shannon divergences, outperform the current best\nvariational score distillation methods across image generation tasks. In\nparticular, when using Jensen-Shannon divergence, $f$-distill achieves current\nstate-of-the-art one-step generation performance on ImageNet64 and zero-shot\ntext-to-image generation on MS-COCO.

      "abstract": "Robotics has long sought to develop visual-servoing robots capable of\ncompleting previously unseen long-horizon tasks. Hierarchical approaches offer\na pathway for achieving this goal by executing skill combinations arranged by a\ntask planner, with each visuomotor skill pre-trained using a specific imitation\nlearning (IL) algorithm. However, even in simple long-horizon tasks like skill\nchaining, hierarchical approaches often struggle due to a problem we identify\nas Observation Space Shift (OSS), where the sequential execution of preceding\nskills causes shifts in the observation space, disrupting the performance of\nsubsequent individually trained skill policies. To validate OSS and evaluate\nits impact on long-horizon tasks, we introduce BOSS (a Benchmark for\nObservation Space Shift). BOSS comprises three distinct challenges: \"Single\nPredicate Shift\", \"Accumulated Predicate Shift\", and \"Skill Chaining\", each\ndesigned to assess a different aspect of OSS's negative effect. We evaluated\nseveral recent popular IL algorithms on BOSS, including three Behavioral\nCloning methods and the Visual Language Action model OpenVLA. Even on the\nsimplest challenge, we observed average performance drops of 67%, 35%, 34%, and\n54%, respectively, when comparing skill performance with and without OSS.\nAdditionally, we investigate a potential solution to OSS that scales up the\ntraining data for each skill with a larger and more visually diverse set of\ndemonstrations, with our results showing it is not sufficient to resolve OSS.\nThe project page is: https://boss-benchmark.github.io/",

However, existing methods\nassume a single-user setting and become inefficient in real-world multi-client\nscenarios, where decentralized organizations (e.g., hospitals, financial\ninstitutions) independently update overlapping knowledge, leading to redundant\nmediator knowledge vector (MKV) computations and privacy concerns. To address\nthese challenges, we introduce Federated Locate-then-Edit Knowledge Editing\n(FLEKE), a novel task that enables multiple clients to collaboratively perform\nLEKE while preserving privacy and reducing computational overhead. To achieve\nthis, we propose FedEdit, a two-stage framework that optimizes MKV selection\nand reuse. In the first stage, clients locally apply LEKE and upload the\ncomputed MKVs. In the second stage, rather than relying solely on server-based\nMKV sharing, FLEKE allows clients retrieve relevant MKVs based on cosine\nsimilarity, enabling knowledge re-edit and minimizing redundant computations.\nExperimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedEdit retains\nover 96% of the performance of non-federated LEKE while significantly\noutperforming a FedAvg-based baseline by approximately twofold. Besides, we\nfind that MEMIT performs more consistently than PMET in the FLEKE task with our\nFedEdit framework. Our code is available at https://github.com/zongkaiz/FLEKE.",

Despite how useful these systems\nmight be, unchecked AI agency poses significant risks to public safety and\nsecurity, ranging from misuse by malicious actors to a potentially irreversible\nloss of human control. We discuss how these risks arise from current AI\ntraining methods. Indeed, various scenarios and experiments have demonstrated\nthe possibility of AI agents engaging in deception or pursuing goals that were\nnot specified by human operators and that conflict with human interests, such\nas self-preservation. Following the precautionary principle, we see a strong\nneed for safer, yet still useful, alternatives to the current agency-driven\ntrajectory. Accordingly, we propose as a core building block for further\nadvances the development of a non-agentic AI system that is trustworthy and\nsafe by design, which we call Scientist AI. This system is designed to explain\nthe world from observations, as opposed to taking actions in it to imitate or\nplease humans. It comprises a world model that generates theories to explain\ndata and a question-answering inference machine. Both components operate with\nan explicit notion of uncertainty to mitigate the risks of overconfident\npredictions. In light of these considerations, a Scientist AI could be used to\nassist human researchers in accelerating scientific progress, including in AI\nsafety. In particular, our system can be employed as a guardrail against AI\nagents that might be created despite the risks involved.

      "abstract": "In recent years recommendation systems typically employ the edge information\nprovided by knowledge graphs combined with the advantages of high-order\nconnectivity of graph networks in the recommendation field. However, this\nmethod is limited by the sparsity of labels, cannot learn the graph structure\nwell, and a large number of noisy entities in the knowledge graph will affect\nthe accuracy of the recommendation results. In order to alleviate the above\nproblems, we propose a dynamic knowledge-selecting and evaluating method guided\nby collaborative signals to distill information in the knowledge graph.\nSpecifically, we use a Chain Route Evaluator to evaluate the contributions of\ndifferent neighborhoods for the recommendation task and employ a Knowledge\nSelector strategy to filter the less informative knowledge before evaluating.\nWe conduct baseline model comparison and experimental ablation evaluations on\nthree public datasets. The experiments demonstrate that our proposed model\noutperforms current state-of-the-art baseline models, and each modules\neffectiveness in our model is demonstrated through ablation experiments.",

PP leverages the insight that not all samples and tokens contribute\nequally to the model's output, and probing a small portion of each batch\neffectively identifies crucial weights, enabling tailored dynamic pruning for\ndifferent batches. It comprises three main stages: probing, history-informed\npruning, and full inference. In the probing stage, PP selects a small yet\ncrucial set of hidden states, based on residual importance, to run a few model\nlayers ahead. During the history-informed pruning stage, PP strategically\nintegrates the probing states with historical states. Subsequently, it\nstructurally prunes weights based on the integrated states and the PP\nimportance score, a metric developed specifically to assess the importance of\neach weight channel in maintaining performance. In the final stage, full\ninference is conducted on the remaining weights. A major advantage of PP is its\ncompatibility with existing models, as it operates without requiring additional\nneural network modules or fine-tuning. Comprehensive evaluations of PP on\nLLaMA-2/3 and OPT models reveal that even minimal probing-using just 1.5% of\nFLOPs-can substantially enhance the efficiency of structured pruning of LLMs.\nFor instance, when evaluated on LLaMA-2-7B with WikiText2, PP achieves a 2.56\ntimes lower ratio of performance degradation per unit of runtime reduction\ncompared to the state-of-the-art method at a 40% pruning ratio.

Our analysis is based upon a comparison with party\nresponses to 38 statements of the Wahl-O-Mat, a well-established German online\ntool that helps inform voters by comparing their views with political party\npositions. For the LLMs, we identify significant biases. They exhibit a strong\nalignment (over 75% on average) with left-wing parties and a substantially\nlower alignment with center-right (smaller 50%) and right-wing parties (around\n30%). Furthermore, for the VAAs, intended to objectively inform voters, we\nfound substantial deviations from the parties' stated positions in Wahl-O-Mat:\nWhile one VAA deviated in 25% of cases, another VAA showed deviations in more\nthan 50% of cases. For the latter, we even observed that simple prompt\ninjections led to severe hallucinations, including false claims such as\nnon-existent connections between political parties and right-wing extremist\nties.",

Our main goal with MVIP\nis to study and push transferability of various state-of-the-art methods within\nrelated downstream tasks towards an efficient deployment of industrial\nclassifiers. Additionally, we intend to push with MVIP research regarding\nseveral modality fusion topics, (automated) synthetic data generation, and\ncomplex data sampling -- combined in a single application-oriented benchmark.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit excellent performance in various tasks.\nHowever, the memory requirements of LLMs present a great challenge when\ndeploying on memory-limited devices, even for quantized LLMs. This paper\nintroduces a framework to compress LLM after quantization further, achieving\nabout 2.2x compression ratio. A compression-aware quantization is first\nproposed to enhance model weight compressibility by re-scaling the model\nparameters before quantization, followed by a pruning method to improve\nfurther. Upon this, we notice that decompression can be a bottleneck during\npractical scenarios. We then give a detailed analysis of the trade-off between\nmemory usage and latency brought by the proposed method. A speed-adaptive\nmethod is proposed to overcome it. The experimental results show inference with\nthe compressed model can achieve a 40% reduction in memory size with negligible\nloss in accuracy and inference speed.",

      "abstract": "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become ubiquitous for efficiently fine-tuning\nfoundation models. However, federated fine-tuning using LoRA is challenging due\nto suboptimal updates arising from traditional federated averaging of\nindividual adapters. Existing solutions either incur prohibitively high\ncommunication cost that scales linearly with the number of clients or suffer\nfrom performance degradation due to limited expressivity. We introduce\nFederated Silver Bullet (Fed-SB), a novel approach for federated fine-tuning of\nLLMs using LoRA-SB, a recently proposed low-rank adaptation method. LoRA-SB\noptimally aligns the optimization trajectory with the ideal low-rank full\nfine-tuning projection by learning a small square matrix (R) between adapters B\nand A, keeping other components fixed. Direct averaging of R guarantees exact\nupdates, substantially reducing communication cost, which remains independent\nof the number of clients, and enables scalability. Fed-SB achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across commonsense reasoning, arithmetic\nreasoning, and language inference tasks while reducing communication costs by\nup to 230x. In private settings, Fed-SB further improves performance by (1)\nreducing trainable parameters, thereby lowering the noise required for\ndifferential privacy and (2) avoiding noise amplification introduced by other\nmethods. Overall, Fed-SB establishes a new Pareto frontier in the tradeoff\nbetween communication and performance, offering an efficient and scalable\nsolution for both private and non-private federated fine-tuning.

This allows us\nto defend in just one forward pass. SPD can not only detect attacks effectively\non open-source models, but also minimizes the misclassification of harmless\ninputs.

We introduce TAME Agent Framework (TAG), a framework for\nconstructing fully decentralized hierarchical multi-agent systems.TAG enables\nhierarchies of arbitrary depth through a novel LevelEnv concept, which\nabstracts each hierarchy level as the environment for the agents above it. This\napproach standardizes information flow between levels while preserving loose\ncoupling, allowing for seamless integration of diverse agent types. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of TAG by implementing hierarchical architectures\nthat combine different RL agents across multiple levels, achieving improved\nperformance over classical multi-agent RL baselines on standard benchmarks. Our\nresults show that decentralized hierarchical organization enhances both\nlearning speed and final performance, positioning TAG as a promising direction\nfor scalable multi-agent systems.",

Accurate and automated segmentation\nof these tumors in whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) is crucial to\nassess tumor burden and monitor disease progression. In this study, we present\nand analyze a fully automated pipeline for NF segmentation in fat-suppressed\nT2-weighted WB-MRI, consisting of three stages: anatomy segmentation, NF\nsegmentation, and tumor candidate classification. In the first stage, we use\nthe MRSegmentator model to generate an anatomy segmentation mask, extended with\na high-risk zone for NFs. This mask is concatenated with the input image as\nanatomical context information for NF segmentation. The second stage employs an\nensemble of 3D anisotropic anatomy-informed U-Nets to produce an NF\nsegmentation confidence mask. In the final stage, tumor candidates are\nextracted from the confidence mask and classified based on radiomic features,\ndistinguishing tumors from non-tumor regions and reducing false positives. We\nevaluate the proposed pipeline on three test sets representing different\nconditions: in-domain data (test set 1), varying imaging protocols and field\nstrength (test set 2), and low tumor burden cases (test set 3). Experimental\nresults show a 68% improvement in per-scan Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), a\n21% increase in per-tumor DSC, and a two-fold improvement in F1 score for tumor\ndetection in high tumor burden cases by integrating anatomy information.
