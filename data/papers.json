      "abstract": "Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality video\ngeneration, but the additional temporal dimension significantly increases\ncomputational costs, making training and inference on long videos prohibitively\nexpensive. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon we term Spatiotemporal\nEnergy Decay in video diffusion models: post-softmax attention scores diminish\nas spatial and temporal distance between tokens increase, akin to the physical\ndecay of signal or waves over space and time in nature. Motivated by this, we\npropose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with $O(n \\log\nn)$ complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute\ndensity, which is significantly more efficient than standard $O(n^2)$ dense\nattention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial\nAttention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to\nspatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal\ndistance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend\ntheir generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive\nexperiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across\nWan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to a 1.9$\\times$ speedup\nover the original dense attention. With minimal tuning, it enables video\ngeneration up to 4$\\times$ longer while reducing training costs by up to\n4.4$\\times$ compared to direct fine-tuning and accelerating inference by up to\n3.7$\\times$ compared to dense attention inference.",

In this paper, we propose the joint evolution dynamics for MARL\ncalled JoyAgents-R1, which first applies Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO) to the joint training of heterogeneous multi-agents. By iteratively\nrefining agents' large language models (LLMs) and memories, the method achieves\nholistic equilibrium with optimal decision-making and memory capabilities.\nSpecifically, JoyAgents-R1 first implements node-wise Monte Carlo sampling on\nthe behavior of each agent across entire reasoning trajectories to enhance GRPO\nsampling efficiency while maintaining policy diversity. Then, our marginal\nbenefit-driven selection strategy identifies top-$K$ sampling groups with\nmaximal reward fluctuations, enabling targeted agent model updates that improve\ntraining stability and maximize joint benefits through cost-effective parameter\nadjustments. Meanwhile, JoyAgents-R1 introduces an adaptive memory evolution\nmechanism that repurposes GRPO rewards as cost-free supervisory signals to\neliminate repetitive reasoning and accelerate convergence.

Berth scheduling and planning are\ninfluenced by a range of factors, including incoming vessel size, waiting\ntimes, and the status of vessels within the port terminal.

For this purpose, we\nmodeled a specific terminal at the Port of New York/New Jersey and developed\nTemporal-IRL. This Temporal-IRL model learns berth scheduling to predict vessel\nsequencing at the terminal and estimate vessel port stay, encompassing both\nwaiting and berthing times, to forecast port congestion.

These architectures have\nincreased the complexity of the overall approach, introducing the need for a\ncustom diffusion formulation, decomposition-dependent stage transitions,\nadd-hoc samplers, or a model cascade. Our contribution, Decomposable Flow\nMatching (DFM), is a simple and effective framework for the progressive\ngeneration of visual media. DFM applies Flow Matching independently at each\nlevel of a user-defined multi-scale representation (such as Laplacian pyramid).\nAs shown by our experiments, our approach improves visual quality for both\nimages and videos, featuring superior results compared to prior multistage\nframeworks. On Imagenet-1k 512px, DFM achieves 35.2% improvements in FDD scores\nover the base architecture and 26.4% over the best-performing baseline, under\nthe same training compute.

In the real\nworld, recommendation systems are driven by user behavior, and since users with\nthe same sensitive feature (e.g., gender and age) tend to have the same\npatterns, recommendation models can easily capture the strong correlation\npreference of sensitive features and thus cause recommendation unfairness.\nDiffusion model (DM) as a new generative model paradigm has achieved great\nsuccess in recommendation systems. DM's ability to model uncertainty and\nrepresent diversity, and its modeling mechanism has a high degree of\nadaptability with the real-world recommendation process with bias.

Simultaneously, recommendation fairness modeling is\ncompleted by injecting multi-interests representational information that\neliminates the bias of sensitive user features into the generated results.

NeRF-based methods\nhave achieved great success in this task. However, they suffer from a\nlocal-global training mismatch between their two key components: the hash\nencoder and the neural network. Specifically, in each training step, only a\nsubset of the hash encoder's parameters is used (local sparse), whereas all\nparameters in the neural network participate (global dense). Consequently, hash\nfeatures generated in each step are highly misaligned, as they come from\ndifferent subsets of the hash encoder. These misalignments from different\ntraining steps are then fed into the neural network, causing repeated\ninconsistent global updates in training, which leads to unstable training,\nslower convergence, and degraded reconstruction quality. Aiming to alleviate\nthe impact of this local-global optimization mismatch, we introduce a\nNormalized Hash Encoder, which enhances feature consistency and mitigates the\nmismatch. Additionally, we propose a Mapping Consistency Initialization(MCI)\nstrategy that initializes the neural network before training by leveraging the\nglobal mapping property from a well-trained model. The initialized neural\nnetwork exhibits improved stability during early training, enabling faster\nconvergence and enhanced reconstruction performance.

However, uncertainty due to model misspecification\ncontinues to limit widespread industrial adoption. This paper proposes a PdM\nframework in which sensor-driven prognostics inform decision-making under\neconomic trade-offs within a finite decision space. We investigate two key\nquestions: (1) Does higher predictive accuracy necessarily lead to better\nmaintenance decisions? (2) If not, how can the impact of prediction errors on\ndownstream maintenance decisions be mitigated? We first demonstrate that in the\ntraditional estimate-then-optimize (ETO) framework, errors in probabilistic\nprediction can result in inconsistent and suboptimal maintenance decisions. To\naddress this, we propose an integrated estimate-optimize (IEO) framework that\njointly tunes predictive models while directly optimizing for maintenance\noutcomes. We establish theoretical finite-sample guarantees on decision\nconsistency under standard assumptions. Specifically, we develop a stochastic\nperturbation gradient descent algorithm suitable for small run-to-failure\ndatasets. Empirical evaluations on a turbofan maintenance case study show that\nthe IEO framework reduces average maintenance regret up to 22% compared to ETO.\nThis study provides a principled approach to managing prediction errors in\ndata-driven PdM. By aligning prognostic model training with maintenance\nobjectives, the IEO framework improves robustness under model misspecification\nand improves decision quality.

      "abstract": "Extreme activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs) critically\ndegrade quantization performance, hindering efficient on-device deployment.\nWhile channel-wise operations and adaptive gradient scaling are recognized\ncauses, practical mitigation remains challenging. We introduce Outlier-Safe\nPre-Training (OSP), a practical guideline that proactively prevents outlier\nformation rather than relying on post-hoc mitigation. OSP combines three key\ninnovations: (1) the Muon optimizer, eliminating privileged bases while\nmaintaining training efficiency; (2) Single-Scale RMSNorm, preventing\nchannel-wise amplification; and (3) a learnable embedding projection,\nredistributing activation magnitudes originating from embedding matrices. We\nvalidate OSP by training a 1.4B-parameter model on 1 trillion tokens, which is\nthe first production-scale LLM trained without such outliers. Under aggressive\n4-bit quantization, our OSP model achieves a 35.7 average score across 10\nbenchmarks (compared to 26.5 for an Adam-trained model), with only a 2%\ntraining overhead. Remarkably, OSP models exhibit near-zero excess kurtosis\n(0.04) compared to extreme values (1818.56) in standard models, fundamentally\naltering LLM quantization behavior. Our work demonstrates that outliers are not\ninherent to LLMs but are consequences of training strategies, paving the way\nfor more efficient LLM deployment.

      "abstract": "Humans and animals show remarkable learning efficiency, adapting to new\nenvironments with minimal experience. This capability is not well captured by\nstandard reinforcement learning algorithms that rely on incremental value\nupdates. Rapid adaptation likely depends on episodic memory -- the ability to\nretrieve specific past experiences to guide decisions in novel contexts.\nTransformers provide a useful setting for studying these questions because of\ntheir ability to learn rapidly in-context and because their key-value\narchitecture resembles episodic memory systems in the brain. We train a\ntransformer to in-context reinforcement learn in a distribution of planning\ntasks inspired by rodent behavior. We then characterize the learning algorithms\nthat emerge in the model. We first find that representation learning is\nsupported by in-context structure learning and cross-context alignment, where\nrepresentations are aligned across environments with different sensory stimuli.\nWe next demonstrate that the reinforcement learning strategies developed by the\nmodel are not interpretable as standard model-free or model-based planning.\nInstead, we show that in-context reinforcement learning is supported by caching\nintermediate computations within the model's memory tokens, which are then\naccessed at decision time. Overall, we find that memory may serve as a\ncomputational resource, storing both raw experience and cached computations to\nsupport flexible behavior. Furthermore, the representations developed in the\nmodel resemble computations associated with the hippocampal-entorhinal system\nin the brain, suggesting that our findings may be relevant for natural\ncognition. Taken together, our work offers a mechanistic hypothesis for the\nrapid adaptation that underlies in-context learning in artificial and natural\nsettings.",

TAPAS employs specialized LLM-based agents that\ncollaboratively generate and adapt domain models, initial states, and goal\nspecifications as needed using structured tool-calling mechanisms. Through this\ntool-based interaction, downstream agents can request modifications from\nupstream agents, enabling adaptation to novel attributes and constraints\nwithout manual domain redefinition. A ReAct (Reason+Act)-style execution agent,\ncoupled with natural language plan translation, bridges the gap between\ndynamically generated plans and real-world robot capabilities.

To manage these computational and storage\ndemands, centralized workflow and data management systems are implemented.\nHowever, decisions regarding data placement and payload allocation are often\nmade disjointly and via heuristic means.

Additionally, we are creating a generative AI\nmodel to simulate time series of payloads, which incorporate visible features\nlike category, event count, and submitting group, as well as hidden features\nlike the total computational load-derived from existing PanDA records and\ncomputing site capabilities.

However, traditional time series forecasting methods suffer from\ninsufficient historical data, which stems from a disregard for the generalized\nand specific features among different tasks. For the aforementioned challenges,\nwe propose the Feature-Adaptive Time Series Forecasting Framework (FAF), which\nconsists of three key components: the Generalized Knowledge Module (GKM), the\nTask-Specific Module (TSM), and the Rank Module (RM). During training phase,\nthe GKM is updated through a meta-learning mechanism that enables the model to\nextract generalized features across related tasks. Meanwhile, the TSM is\ntrained to capture diverse local dynamics through multiple functional regions,\neach of which learns specific features from individual tasks. During testing\nphase, the RM dynamically selects the most relevant functional region from the\nTSM based on input sequence features, which is then combined with the\ngeneralized knowledge learned by the GKM to generate accurate forecasts. This\ndesign enables FAF to achieve robust and personalized forecasting even with\nsparse historical observations We evaluate FAF on five diverse real-world\ndatasets under few-shot time series forecasting settings. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that FAF consistently outperforms baselines that include three\ncategories of time series forecasting methods. In particular, FAF achieves a\n41.81\\% improvement over the best baseline, iTransformer, on the CO$_2$\nemissions dataset.",

Privacy extraction attacks, such as\njailbreaking, expose vulnerabilities in LLMs by crafting inputs that force the\nmodels to output sensitive information. However, these attacks cannot verify\nwhether the extracted private information is accurate, as no public datasets\nexist for cross-validation, leaving a critical gap in private information\ndetection during inference. To address this, we propose PrivacyXray, a novel\nframework detecting privacy breaches by analyzing LLM inner states. Our\nanalysis reveals that LLMs exhibit higher semantic coherence and probabilistic\ncertainty when generating correct private outputs. Based on this, PrivacyXray\ndetects privacy breaches using four metrics: intra-layer and inter-layer\nsemantic similarity, token-level and sentence-level probability distributions.\nPrivacyXray addresses critical challenges in private information detection by\novercoming the lack of open-source private datasets and eliminating reliance on\nexternal data for validation. It achieves this through the synthesis of\nrealistic private data and a detection mechanism based on the inner states of\nLLMs. Experiments show that PrivacyXray achieves consistent performance, with\nan average accuracy of 92.69% across five LLMs. Compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods, PrivacyXray achieves significant improvements, with an average\naccuracy increase of 20.06%, highlighting its stability and practical utility\nin real-world applications.",

In this paper, we introduce\nMambaOutRS, a novel hybrid convolutional architecture for remote sensing image\nclassification that re-evaluates the necessity of recurrent SSMs. MambaOutRS\nbuilds upon stacked Gated CNN blocks for local feature extraction and\nintroduces a novel Fourier Filter Gate (FFG) module that operates in the\nfrequency domain to capture global contextual information efficiently. Our\narchitecture employs a four-stage hierarchical design and was extensively\nevaluated on challenging remote sensing datasets: UC Merced, AID,\nNWPU-RESISC45, and EuroSAT. MambaOutRS consistently achieved state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) performance across these benchmarks. Notably, our MambaOutRS-t variant\n(24.0M parameters) attained the highest F1-scores of 98.41\\% on UC Merced and\n95.99\\% on AID, significantly outperforming existing baselines, including\nlarger transformer models and Mamba-based architectures, despite using\nconsiderably fewer parameters. An ablation study conclusively demonstrates the\ncritical role of the Fourier Filter Gate in enhancing the model's ability to\ncapture global spatial patterns, leading to robust and accurate classification.\nThese results strongly suggest that the complexities of recurrent SSMs can be\neffectively superseded by a judicious combination of gated convolutions for\nspatial mixing and frequency-based gates for spectral global context.
