      "abstract": "Large Multimodal Models (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini, Chameleon) have evolved into\npowerful tools with millions of users. However, they remain generic models and\nlack personalized knowledge of specific user concepts. Previous work has\nexplored personalization for text generation, yet it remains unclear how these\nmethods can be adapted to new modalities, such as image generation. In this\npaper, we introduce Yo'Chameleon, the first attempt to study personalization\nfor large multimodal models. Given 3-5 images of a particular concept,\nYo'Chameleon leverages soft-prompt tuning to embed subject-specific information\nto (i) answer questions about the subject and (ii) recreate pixel-level details\nto produce images of the subject in new contexts. Yo'Chameleon is trained with\n(i) a self-prompting optimization mechanism to balance performance across\nmultiple modalities, and (ii) a ``soft-positive\" image generation approach to\nenhance image quality in a few-shot setting.",

      "abstract": "A burgeoning area within reinforcement learning (RL) is the design of\nsequential decision-making agents centered around large language models (LLMs).\nWhile autonomous decision-making agents powered by modern LLMs could facilitate\nnumerous real-world applications, such successes demand agents that are capable\nof data-efficient RL. One key obstacle to achieving data efficiency in RL is\nexploration, a challenge that we demonstrate many recent proposals for LLM\nagent designs struggle to contend with. Meanwhile, classic algorithms from the\nRL literature known to gracefully address exploration require technical\nmachinery that can be challenging to operationalize in purely natural language\nsettings. In this work, rather than relying on finetuning or in-context\nlearning to coax LLMs into implicitly imitating a RL algorithm, we illustrate\nhow LLMs can be used to explicitly implement an existing RL algorithm\n(Posterior Sampling for Reinforcement Learning) whose capacity for\nstatistically-efficient exploration is already well-studied. We offer empirical\nresults demonstrating how our LLM-based implementation of a known,\ndata-efficient RL algorithm can be considerably more effective in natural\nlanguage tasks that demand prudent exploration.",

HSL employs a two-tier\ncommunication structure that avoids the single point of failure inherent in FL\nand outperforms the state-of-the-art P2PL framework, Epidemic Learning Local\n(ELL). At equal communication budgets (total edges), HSL achieves higher\nperformance than ELL, while at significantly lower communication budgets, it\ncan match ELL's performance. For instance, with only 400 edges, HSL reaches the\nsame test accuracy that ELL achieves with 1000 edges for 100 peers (spokes) on\nCIFAR-10, demonstrating its suitability for resource-constrained systems. HSL\nalso achieves stronger consensus among nodes after mixing, resulting in\nimproved performance with fewer training rounds.

Existing approaches for bias identification rely on datasets containing\nlabels for the task of interest, something that a non-expert may not have\naccess to, or may not have the necessary resources to collect: this greatly\nlimits the number of tasks where model biases can be identified. In this work,\nwe present Classifier-to-Bias (C2B), the first bias discovery framework that\nworks without access to any labeled data: it only relies on a textual\ndescription of the classification task to identify biases in the target\nclassification model. This description is fed to a large language model to\ngenerate bias proposals and corresponding captions depicting biases together\nwith task-specific target labels. A retrieval model collects images for those\ncaptions, which are then used to assess the accuracy of the model w.r.t. the\ngiven biases. C2B is training-free, does not require any annotations, has no\nconstraints on the list of biases, and can be applied to any pre-trained model\non any classification task. Experiments on two publicly available datasets show\nthat C2B discovers biases beyond those of the original datasets and outperforms\na recent state-of-the-art bias detection baseline that relies on task-specific\nannotations, being a promising first step toward addressing task-agnostic\nunsupervised bias detection.",

We find that\nundisclosed private testing practices benefit a handful of providers who are\nable to test multiple variants before public release and retract scores if\ndesired. We establish that the ability of these providers to choose the best\nscore leads to biased Arena scores due to selective disclosure of performance\nresults. At an extreme, we identify 27 private LLM variants tested by Meta in\nthe lead-up to the Llama-4 release. We also establish that proprietary closed\nmodels are sampled at higher rates (number of battles) and have fewer models\nremoved from the arena than open-weight and open-source alternatives. Both\nthese policies lead to large data access asymmetries over time. Providers like\nGoogle and OpenAI have received an estimated 19.2% and 20.4% of all data on the\narena, respectively. In contrast, a combined 83 open-weight models have only\nreceived an estimated 29.7% of the total data.

However, recent\nstudies have found that current GNNs are susceptible to malicious adversarial\nattacks. Given the inevitable presence of adversarial attacks in the real\nworld, a variety of defense methods have been proposed to counter these attacks\nand enhance the robustness of GNNs. Despite the commendable performance of\nthese defense methods, we have observed that they tend to exhibit a structural\nbias in terms of their defense capability on nodes with low degree (i.e., tail\nnodes), which is similar to the structural bias of traditional GNNs on nodes\nwith low degree in the clean graph. Therefore, in this work, we propose a\ndefense strategy by including hetero-homo augmented graph construction, $k$NN\naugmented graph construction, and multi-view node-wise attention modules to\nmitigate the structural bias of GNNs against adversarial attacks. Notably, the\nhetero-homo augmented graph consists of removing heterophilic links (i.e.,\nlinks connecting nodes with dissimilar features) globally and adding homophilic\nlinks (i.e., links connecting nodes with similar features) for nodes with low\ndegree. To further enhance the defense capability, an attention mechanism is\nadopted to adaptively combine the representations from the above two kinds of\ngraph views. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the defense and\ndebiasing effect of the proposed strategy on benchmark datasets.",

To\naddress this, Ascendra employs a performance model to predict requests at risk\nof missing their SLOs and proactively offloads them to high-priority instances.\nHigh-priority instances are optimized for low-latency execution and handle\nurgent requests nearing their deadlines. This partitioned architecture enables\nAscendra to effectively balance high throughput and low latency. Extensive\nevaluation shows that Ascendra improves system throughput by up to 1.7x\ncompared to vLLM and Sarathi-Serve while meeting both TTFT and TBT SLOs.",

The graph transformer, with\nits advantages of high performance and scalability compared to traditional\ngraph networks, has been widely explored in recent research for applications of\ngraph structures. However, current transformer-based graph decoders struggle to\neffectively utilize graph information, which limits their capacity to leverage\nonly sequences of nodes rather than the complex topological structures of\nmolecule graphs. This paper focuses on building a graph transformer-based\nframework for molecular generation, which we call \\textbf{JTreeformer} as it\ntransforms graph generation into junction tree generation. It combines GCN\nparallel with multi-head attention as the encoder. It integrates a directed\nacyclic GCN into a graph-based Transformer to serve as a decoder, which can\niteratively synthesize the entire molecule by leveraging information from the\npartially constructed molecular structure at each step. In addition, a\ndiffusion model is inserted in the latent space generated by the encoder, to\nenhance the efficiency and effectiveness of sampling further. The empirical\nresults demonstrate that our novel framework outperforms existing molecule\ngeneration methods, thus offering a promising tool to advance drug discovery\n(https://anonymous.4open.science/r/JTreeformer-C74C).",

      "abstract": "Public vulnerability databases, such as the National Vulnerability Database\n(NVD), document vulnerabilities and facilitate threat information sharing.\nHowever, they often suffer from short descriptions and outdated or insufficient\ninformation. In this paper, we introduce Zad, a system designed to enrich NVD\nvulnerability descriptions by leveraging external resources. Zad consists of\ntwo pipelines: one collects and filters supplementary data using two encoders\nto build a detailed dataset, while the other fine-tunes a pre-trained model on\nthis dataset to generate enriched descriptions. By addressing brevity and\nimproving content quality, Zad produces more comprehensive and cohesive\nvulnerability descriptions. We evaluate Zad using standard summarization\nmetrics and human assessments, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing\nvulnerability information.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) leverage step-by-step reasoning to solve complex\nproblems. Standard evaluation practice involves generating a complete reasoning\ntrace and assessing the correctness of the final answer presented at its\nconclusion. In this paper, we challenge the reliance on the final answer by\nposing the following two questions: Does the final answer reliably represent\nthe model's optimal conclusion? Can alternative reasoning paths yield different\nresults? To answer these questions, we analyze intermediate reasoning steps,\ntermed subthoughts, and propose a method based on our findings. Our approach\ninvolves segmenting a reasoning trace into sequential subthoughts based on\nlinguistic cues. We start by prompting the model to generate continuations from\nthe end-point of each intermediate subthought. We extract a potential answer\nfrom every completed continuation originating from different subthoughts. We\nfind that aggregating these answers by selecting the most frequent one (the\nmode) often yields significantly higher accuracy compared to relying solely on\nthe answer derived from the original complete trace. Analyzing the consistency\namong the answers derived from different subthoughts reveals characteristics\nthat correlate with the model's confidence and correctness, suggesting\npotential for identifying less reliable answers. Our experiments across various\nLLMs and challenging mathematical reasoning datasets (AIME2024 and AIME2025)\nshow consistent accuracy improvements, with gains reaching up to 13\\% and 10\\%\nrespectively.

We study how model performance\nvaries across tasks and language and we investigate the impact of model size,\ninstruction tuning, and prompt choice.

Our key theoretical contributions include: (1) a\ncomplexity gap theorem proving that any explanation significantly simpler than\nthe original model must differ from it on some inputs; (2) precise bounds\nshowing that explanation complexity grows exponentially with input dimension\nbut polynomially with error tolerance for Lipschitz functions; and (3) a\ncharacterization of the gap between local and global explainability,\ndemonstrating that local explanations can be significantly simpler while\nmaintaining accuracy in relevant regions. We further establish a regulatory\nimpossibility theorem proving that no governance framework can simultaneously\npursue unrestricted AI capabilities, human-interpretable explanations, and\nnegligible error.
