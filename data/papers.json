      "abstract": "Reasoning before action and imagining potential outcomes (i.e., world models)\nare essential for embodied agents operating in complex open-world environments.\nYet, prior work either incorporates only one of these abilities in an\nend-to-end agent or integrates multiple specialized models into an agent\nsystem, limiting the learning efficiency and generalization of the policy.\nThus, this paper makes the first attempt to synergize Reasoning and Imagination\nin an end-to-end Generalist policy, termed RIG. To train RIG in an end-to-end\nmanner, we construct a data pipeline that progressively integrates and enriches\nthe content of imagination and reasoning in the trajectories collected from\nexisting agents. The joint learning of reasoning and next image generation\nexplicitly models the inherent correlation between reasoning, action, and\ndynamics of environments, and thus exhibits more than $17\\times$ sample\nefficiency improvements and generalization in comparison with previous works.\nDuring inference, RIG first reasons about the next action, produces potential\naction, and then predicts the action outcomes, which offers the agent a chance\nto review and self-correct based on the imagination before taking real actions.\nExperimental results show that the synergy of reasoning and imagination not\nonly improves the robustness, generalization, and interoperability of\ngeneralist policy but also enables test-time scaling to enhance overall\nperformance.",

      "abstract": "The ACPBench dataset provides atomic reasoning tasks required for efficient\nplanning. The dataset is aimed at distilling the complex plan generation task\ninto separate atomic reasoning tasks in their easiest possible form, boolean or\nmultiple-choice questions, where the model has to choose the right answer from\nthe provided options. While the aim of ACPBench is to test the simplest form of\nreasoning about action and change, when tasked with planning, a model does not\ntypically have options to choose from and thus the reasoning required for\nplanning dictates an open-ended, generative form for these tasks. To that end,\nwe introduce ACPBench Hard, a generative version of ACPBench, with open-ended\nquestions which the model needs to answer. Models that perform well on these\ntasks could in principle be integrated into a planner or be used directly as a\npolicy. We discuss the complexity of these tasks as well as the complexity of\nvalidating the correctness of their answers and present validation algorithms\nfor each task. Equipped with these validators, we test the performance of a\nvariety of models on our tasks and find that for most of these tasks the\nperformance of even the largest models is still subpar. Our experiments show\nthat no model outperforms another in these tasks and with a few exceptions all\ntested language models score below 65%, indicating that even the current\nfrontier language models have a long way to go before they can reliably reason\nabout planning. In fact, even the so-called reasoning models struggle with\nsolving these reasoning tasks. ACPBench Hard collection is available at the\nfollowing link: https://ibm.github.io/ACPBench",

      "abstract": "Large real-world robot datasets hold great potential to train generalist\nrobot models, but scaling real-world human data collection is time-consuming\nand resource-intensive. Simulation has great potential in supplementing\nlarge-scale data, especially with recent advances in generative AI and\nautomated data generation tools that enable scalable creation of robot behavior\ndatasets. However, training a policy solely in simulation and transferring it\nto the real world often demands substantial human effort to bridge the reality\ngap. A compelling alternative is to co-train the policy on a mixture of\nsimulation and real-world datasets. Preliminary studies have recently shown\nthis strategy to substantially improve the performance of a policy over one\ntrained on a limited amount of real-world data. Nonetheless, the community\nlacks a systematic understanding of sim-and-real co-training and what it takes\nto reap the benefits of simulation data for real-robot learning. This work\npresents a simple yet effective recipe for utilizing simulation data to solve\nvision-based robotic manipulation tasks. We derive this recipe from\ncomprehensive experiments that validate the co-training strategy on various\nsimulation and real-world datasets. Using two domains--a robot arm and a\nhumanoid--across diverse tasks, we demonstrate that simulation data can enhance\nreal-world task performance by an average of 38%, even with notable differences\nbetween the simulation and real-world data.

Building upon\nthe BEATS framework, we present a bias benchmark for LLMs that measure\nperformance across 29 distinct metrics. These metrics span a broad range of\ncharacteristics, including demographic, cognitive, and social biases, as well\nas measures of ethical reasoning, group fairness, and factuality related\nmisinformation risk. These metrics enable a quantitative assessment of the\nextent to which LLM generated responses may perpetuate societal prejudices that\nreinforce or expand systemic inequities.

Empirical results based on\ndata from our experiment show that, 37.65\\% of outputs generated by industry\nleading models contained some form of bias, highlighting a substantial risk of\nusing these models in critical decision making systems.

Evaluation of increasingly generalist robot policies\nrequires an increasingly diverse repertoire of evaluation environments, making\nthe evaluation bottleneck even more pronounced.

SAEs\nare based on the linear representation hypothesis (LRH), which assumes that the\nrepresentations of large language models (LLMs) are linearly encoded, and the\nsuperposition hypothesis (SH), which states that there can be more features in\nthe model than its dimensionality. We show that, based on the formal\ndefinitions of the LRH and SH, the magnitude of sparse feature vectors (the\nlatent representations learned by SAEs of the dense embeddings of LLMs) can be\napproximated using their corresponding dense vector with a closed-form error\nbound.

Correspondingly, we introduce Approximate Feature Activation (AFA),\nwhich approximates the magnitude of the ground-truth sparse feature vector, and\npropose a new evaluation metric derived from AFA to assess the alignment\nbetween inputs and activations.

Recent works attempt to enhance\nhigh-quality novel view synthesis from the motion blur by leveraging\nevent-based cameras, benefiting from high dynamic range and microsecond\ntemporal resolution. However, they often reach sub-optimal visual quality in\neither restoring inaccurate color or losing fine-grained details. In this\npaper, we present DiET-GS, a diffusion prior and event stream-assisted motion\ndeblurring 3DGS. Our framework effectively leverages both blur-free event\nstreams and diffusion prior in a two-stage training strategy. Specifically, we\nintroduce the novel framework to constraint 3DGS with event double integral,\nachieving both accurate color and well-defined details. Additionally, we\npropose a simple technique to leverage diffusion prior to further enhance the\nedge details. Qualitative and quantitative results on both synthetic and\nreal-world data demonstrate that our DiET-GS is capable of producing\nsignificantly better quality of novel views compared to the existing baselines.\nOur project page is https://diet-gs.github.io",

Among NSCLC\npatients, approximately 32.3% have mutations in the epidermal growth factor\nreceptor (EGFR) gene. Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase\ninhibitor (TKI), has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in the treatment of NSCLC\npatients with activating and T790M resistance EGFR mutations. Despite its\nestablished efficacy, drug resistance poses a significant challenge for\npatients to fully benefit from osimertinib. The absence of a standard tool to\naccurately predict TKI resistance, including that of osimertinib, remains a\ncritical obstacle. To bridge this gap, in this study, we developed an\ninterpretable multimodal machine learning model designed to predict patient\nresistance to osimertinib among late-stage NSCLC patients with activating EGFR\nmutations, achieving a c-index of 0.82 on a multi-institutional dataset. This\nmachine learning model harnesses readily available data routinely collected\nduring patient visits and medical assessments to facilitate precision lung\ncancer management and informed treatment decisions. By integrating various data\ntypes such as histology images, next generation sequencing (NGS) data,\ndemographics data, and clinical records, our multimodal model can generate\nwell-informed recommendations.

      "abstract": "With the rapid development of multimodal models, the demand for assessing\nvideo understanding capabilities has been steadily increasing. However,\nexisting benchmarks for evaluating video understanding exhibit significant\nlimitations in coverage, task diversity, and scene adaptability. These\nshortcomings hinder the accurate assessment of models' comprehensive video\nunderstanding capabilities. To tackle this challenge, we propose a hierarchical\nand holistic video understanding (H2VU) benchmark designed to evaluate both\ngeneral video and online streaming video comprehension. This benchmark\ncontributes three key features:\n  Extended video duration: Spanning videos from brief 3-second clips to\ncomprehensive 1.5-hour recordings, thereby bridging the temporal gaps found in\ncurrent benchmarks. Comprehensive assessment tasks: Beyond traditional\nperceptual and reasoning tasks, we have introduced modules for\ncountercommonsense comprehension and trajectory state tracking. These additions\ntest the models' deep understanding capabilities beyond mere prior knowledge.\nEnriched video data: To keep pace with the rapid evolution of current AI\nagents, we have expanded first-person streaming video datasets. This expansion\nallows for the exploration of multimodal models' performance in understanding\nstreaming videos from a first-person perspective. Extensive results from H2VU\nreveal that existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) possess\nsubstantial potential for improvement in our newly proposed evaluation tasks.\nWe expect that H2VU will facilitate advancements in video understanding\nresearch by offering a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of MLLMs.",

      "abstract": "Covariates play an indispensable role in practical time series forecasting,\noffering rich context from the past and sometimes extending into the future.\nHowever, their availability varies depending on the scenario, and situations\noften involve multiple target variables simultaneously. Moreover, the\ncross-variate dependencies between them are multi-granular, with some\ncovariates having a short-term impact on target variables and others showing\nlong-term correlations. This heterogeneity and the intricate dependencies\narising in covariate-informed forecasting present significant challenges to\nexisting deep models. To address these issues, we propose CITRAS, a patch-based\nTransformer that flexibly leverages multiple targets and covariates covering\nboth the past and the future forecasting horizon. While preserving the strong\nautoregressive capabilities of the canonical Transformer, CITRAS introduces two\nnovel mechanisms in patch-wise cross-variate attention: Key-Value (KV) Shift\nand Attention Score Smoothing. KV Shift seamlessly incorporates future known\ncovariates into the forecasting of target variables based on their concurrent\ndependencies. Additionally, Attention Score Smoothing transforms locally\naccurate patch-wise cross-variate dependencies into global variate-level\ndependencies by smoothing the past series of attention scores. Experimentally,\nCITRAS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both covariate-informed and\nmultivariate forecasting, demonstrating its versatile ability to leverage\ncross-variate dependency for improved forecasting accuracy.",

It\nprimarily decreases the memory consumption of \\texttt{KV} \\texttt{cache} to\nreduce the computation cost. Despite the development of many compression\nalgorithms, their applications in production environments are still not\nprevalent. In this paper, we revisit mainstream \\texttt{KV} \\texttt{cache}\ncompression solutions from a practical perspective. Our contributions are\nthree-fold. First, we comprehensively review existing algorithmic designs and\nbenchmark studies for \\texttt{KV} \\texttt{cache} compression and identify\nmissing pieces in their performance measurement, which could hinder their\nadoption in practice. Second, we empirically evaluate representative\n\\texttt{KV} \\texttt{cache} compression methods to uncover two key issues that\naffect the computational efficiency: (1) while compressing \\texttt{KV}\n\\texttt{cache} can reduce memory consumption, current implementations (e.g.,\nFlashAttention, PagedAttention) do not optimize for production-level LLM\nserving, resulting in suboptimal throughput performance; (2) compressing\n\\texttt{KV} \\texttt{cache} may lead to longer outputs, resulting in increased\nend-to-end latency. We further investigate the accuracy performance of\nindividual samples rather than the overall performance, revealing the intrinsic\nlimitations in \\texttt{KV} \\texttt{cache} compression when handling specific\nLLM tasks.

By incorporating the denoising\nmechanism of the diffusion model, DenseFormer generates the dense depth map by\nprogressively refining an initial random depth distribution through multiple\niterations. We propose a feature extraction module that leverages a feature\npyramid structure, along with multi-layer deformable attention, to effectively\nextract and integrate features from sparse depth maps and RGB images, which\nserve as the guiding condition for the diffusion process. Additionally, this\npaper presents a depth refinement module that applies multi-step iterative\nrefinement across various ranges to the dense depth results generated by the\ndiffusion process. The module utilizes image features enriched with multi-scale\ninformation and sparse depth input to further enhance the accuracy of the\npredicted depth map. Extensive experiments on the KITTI outdoor scene dataset\ndemonstrate that DenseFormer outperforms classical depth completion methods.",

The purpose of this article is to\nconsider the opposite situation: we view a randomly initialized Multi-Layer\nPerceptron (MLP) as a Hamiltonian over its inputs. For typical realizations of\nthe network parameters, we study the properties of the energy landscape induced\nby this Hamiltonian, focusing on the structure of near-global minimum in the\nlimit of infinite width. Specifically, we use the replica trick to perform an\nexact analytic calculation giving the entropy (log volume of space) at a given\nenergy. We further derive saddle point equations that describe the overlaps\nbetween inputs sampled iid from the Gibbs distribution induced by the random\nMLP. For linear activations we solve these saddle point equations exactly. But\nwe also solve them numerically for a variety of depths and activation\nfunctions, including $\\tanh, \\sin, \\text{ReLU}$, and shaped non-linearities. We\nfind even at infinite width a rich range of behaviors.

While noise-based alternatives like\nreward-modulated Hebbian learning (RMHL) have been proposed, their performance\nhas remained limited, especially in scenarios with delayed rewards, which\nrequire retrospective credit assignment over time. Here, we derive a novel\nnoise-based learning rule that addresses these challenges.

Drawing on concepts from neuroscience, our method\nuses reward prediction error as its optimization target to generate\nincreasingly advantageous behavior, and incorporates an eligibility trace to\nfacilitate temporal credit assignment in environments with delayed rewards. Its\nformulation relies on local information alone, making it compatible with\nimplementations in neuromorphic hardware.
