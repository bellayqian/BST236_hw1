      "abstract": "Effective multi-shot generation demands purposeful, film-like transitions and\nstrict cinematic continuity. Current methods, however, often prioritize basic\nvisual consistency, neglecting crucial editing patterns (e.g., shot/reverse\nshot, cutaways) that drive narrative flow for compelling storytelling. This\nyields outputs that may be visually coherent but lack narrative sophistication\nand true cinematic integrity. To bridge this, we introduce Next Shot Generation\n(NSG): synthesizing a subsequent, high-quality shot that critically conforms to\nprofessional editing patterns while upholding rigorous cinematic continuity.\nOur framework, Cut2Next, leverages a Diffusion Transformer (DiT). It employs\nin-context tuning guided by a novel Hierarchical Multi-Prompting strategy. This\nstrategy uses Relational Prompts to define overall context and inter-shot\nediting styles. Individual Prompts then specify per-shot content and\ncinematographic attributes. Together, these guide Cut2Next to generate\ncinematically appropriate next shots. Architectural innovations, Context-Aware\nCondition Injection (CACI) and Hierarchical Attention Mask (HAM), further\nintegrate these diverse signals without introducing new parameters. We\nconstruct RawCuts (large-scale) and CuratedCuts (refined) datasets, both with\nhierarchical prompts, and introduce CutBench for evaluation. Experiments show\nCut2Next excels in visual consistency and text fidelity. Crucially, user\nstudies reveal a strong preference for Cut2Next, particularly for its adherence\nto intended editing patterns and overall cinematic continuity, validating its\nability to generate high-quality, narratively expressive, and cinematically\ncoherent subsequent shots.",

      "abstract": "We present LL3M, a multi-agent system that leverages pretrained large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to generate 3D assets by writing interpretable Python\ncode in Blender. We break away from the typical generative approach that learns\nfrom a collection of 3D data. Instead, we reformulate shape generation as a\ncode-writing task, enabling greater modularity, editability, and integration\nwith artist workflows. Given a text prompt, LL3M coordinates a team of\nspecialized LLM agents to plan, retrieve, write, debug, and refine Blender\nscripts that generate and edit geometry and appearance. The generated code\nworks as a high-level, interpretable, human-readable, well-documented\nrepresentation of scenes and objects, making full use of sophisticated Blender\nconstructs (e.g. B-meshes, geometry modifiers, shader nodes) for diverse,\nunconstrained shapes, materials, and scenes. This code presents many avenues\nfor further agent and human editing and experimentation via code tweaks or\nprocedural parameters. This medium naturally enables a co-creative loop in our\nsystem: agents can automatically self-critique using code and visuals, while\niterative user instructions provide an intuitive way to refine assets. A shared\ncode context across agents enables awareness of previous attempts, and a\nretrieval-augmented generation knowledge base built from Blender API\ndocumentation, BlenderRAG, equips agents with examples, types, and functions\nempowering advanced modeling operations and code correctness.

However, a\nfundamental gap exists between the LQ image latent distribution and the\nGaussian noisy latent distribution, limiting the effective utilization of\ngenerative priors.

This study positions GPT-5 as a generalist\nmultimodal reasoner for medical decision support and systematically evaluates\nits zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning performance on both text-based\nquestion answering and visual question answering tasks under a unified\nprotocol. We benchmark GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano, and GPT-4o-2024-11-20\nagainst standardized splits of MedQA, MedXpertQA (text and multimodal), MMLU\nmedical subsets, USMLE self-assessment exams, and VQA-RAD. Results show that\nGPT-5 consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving state-of-the-art\naccuracy across all QA benchmarks and delivering substantial gains in\nmultimodal reasoning. On MedXpertQA MM, GPT-5 improves reasoning and\nunderstanding scores by +29.62% and +36.18% over GPT-4o, respectively, and\nsurpasses pre-licensed human experts by +24.23% in reasoning and +29.40% in\nunderstanding.

A representative case study demonstrates GPT-5's ability to\nintegrate visual and textual cues into a coherent diagnostic reasoning chain,\nrecommending appropriate high-stakes interventions.

      "abstract": "Transformers have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in multi-step\nreasoning tasks. However, understandings of the underlying mechanisms by which\nthey acquire these abilities through training remain limited, particularly from\na theoretical standpoint. This work investigates how transformers learn to\nsolve symbolic multi-step reasoning problems through chain-of-thought\nprocesses, focusing on path-finding in trees. We analyze two intertwined tasks:\na backward reasoning task, where the model outputs a path from a goal node to\nthe root, and a more complex forward reasoning task, where the model implements\ntwo-stage reasoning by first identifying the goal-to-root path and then\nreversing it to produce the root-to-goal path. Our theoretical analysis,\ngrounded in the dynamics of gradient descent, shows that trained one-layer\ntransformers can provably solve both tasks with generalization guarantees to\nunseen trees. In particular, our multi-phase training dynamics for forward\nreasoning elucidate how different attention heads learn to specialize and\ncoordinate autonomously to solve the two subtasks in a single autoregressive\npath. These results provide a mechanistic explanation of how trained\ntransformers can implement sequential algorithmic procedures. Moreover, they\noffer insights into the emergence of reasoning abilities, suggesting that when\ntasks are structured to take intermediate chain-of-thought steps, even shallow\nmulti-head transformers can effectively solve problems that would otherwise\nrequire deeper architectures.",

Its multimodal capabilities enable processing\nof both textual and visual data, facilitating more efficient and comprehensive\nanalysis.

A key challenge underlying this limitation is the\nmodality gap between speech and text representations. The high variability in\nspeech embeddings may allow SLMs to achieve strong in-domain performance by\nexploiting unintended speech variations, ultimately hindering generalization.\nTo mitigate this modality gap, we introduce Optimal Transport Regularization\n(OTReg), a method that formulates speech-text alignment as an optimal transport\nproblem and derives a regularization loss to improve SLM training. In each\ntraining iteration, OTReg first establishes a structured correspondence between\nspeech and transcript embeddings by determining the optimal transport plan,\nthen incorporates the regularization loss based on this transport plan to\noptimize SLMs in generating speech embeddings that align more effectively with\ntranscript embeddings. OTReg is lightweight, requiring no additional labels or\nlearnable parameters, and integrates seamlessly into existing SLM training\nprocedures. Extensive multilingual ASR experiments demonstrate that OTReg\nenhances speech-text alignment, mitigates the modality gap, and consequently\nimproves SLM generalization across diverse datasets.",

This research presents Grid2Guide, a hybrid\nnavigation framework that combines the A* search algorithm with a Small\nLanguage Model (SLM) to generate clear, human-readable route instructions. The\nframework first conducts a binary occupancy matrix from a given indoor map.\nUsing this matrix, the A* algorithm computes the optimal path between origin\nand destination, producing concise textual navigation steps. These steps are\nthen transformed into natural language instructions by the SLM, enhancing\ninterpretability for end users.

As a result, using different\ndata sources or models to generate basic probability assignments may lead to\nheterogeneous frames, for which traditional fusion methods often yield\nunsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, this study proposes an\nopen-world information fusion method, termed Full Negation Belief\nTransformation (FNBT), based on the Dempster-Shafer theory.

Then, by extending the frames, the method can accommodate\nelements from heterogeneous frames. Finally, a full negation mechanism is\nemployed to transform the mass functions, so that existing combination rules\ncan be applied to the transformed mass functions for such information fusion.\nTheoretically, the proposed method satisfies three desirable properties, which\nare formally proven: mass function invariance, heritability, and essential\nconflict elimination.

FINER\nconstructs learning patterns that facilitate the retrieval of FPTs from\nhistorical ITS data in linear time; FINER includes a novel similarity-aware\nattention mechanism that aggregates FPTs based on both frequency and contextual\nsimilarity; and FINER offers means of combining FPTs and historical learning\nsequences to enable more accurate prediction of student future performance.\nExperiments on six real-world datasets show that FINER can outperform ten\nstate-of-the-art KT methods, increasing accuracy by 8.74% to 84.85%.",

      "abstract": "Extensive experiments and prior studies show that no single maximum clique\nalgorithm consistently performs best across all instances, highlighting the\nimportance of selecting suitable algorithms based on instance features. Through\nan extensive analysis of relevant studies, it is found that there is a lack of\nresearch work concerning algorithm selection oriented toward the Maximum Clique\nProblem (MCP). In this work, we propose a learning-based framework that\nintegrates both traditional machine learning and graph neural networks to\naddress this gap. We construct a labeled dataset by running four exact MCP\nalgorithms on a diverse collection of graph instances, accompanied by\nstructural and global statistical features extracted from each graph. We first\nevaluate four conventional classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random\nForest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), across multiple\ndataset variants. Experimental results show that RF consistently shows strong\nperformance across metrics and dataset variants, making it a reliable baseline.\nIn addition, feature importance analysis indicates that connectivity and\ntopological structure are strong predictors of algorithm performance. Building\non these findings, we develop a dual-channel model named GAT-MLP, which\ncombines a Graph Attention Network (GAT) for local structural encoding with a\nMultilayer Perceptron (MLP) for global feature modeling. The GAT-MLP model\nshows strong and consistent performance across all metrics. Our results\nhighlight the effectiveness of dual-channel architectures and the promise of\ngraph neural networks in combinatorial algorithm selection.",

      "abstract": "Visual effects (VFX) are essential visual enhancements fundamental to modern\ncinematic production. Although video generation models offer cost-efficient\nsolutions for VFX production, current methods are constrained by per-effect\nLoRA training, which limits generation to single effects. This fundamental\nlimitation impedes applications that require spatially controllable composite\neffects, i.e., the concurrent generation of multiple effects at designated\nlocations. However, integrating diverse effects into a unified framework faces\nmajor challenges: interference from effect variations and spatial\nuncontrollability during multi-VFX joint training. To tackle these challenges,\nwe propose Omni-Effects, a first unified framework capable of generating\nprompt-guided effects and spatially controllable composite effects. The core of\nour framework comprises two key innovations: (1) LoRA-based Mixture of Experts\n(LoRA-MoE), which employs a group of expert LoRAs, integrating diverse effects\nwithin a unified model while effectively mitigating cross-task interference.\n(2) Spatial-Aware Prompt (SAP) incorporates spatial mask information into the\ntext token, enabling precise spatial control. Furthermore, we introduce an\nIndependent-Information Flow (IIF) module integrated within the SAP, isolating\nthe control signals corresponding to individual effects to prevent any unwanted\nblending. To facilitate this research, we construct a comprehensive VFX dataset\nOmni-VFX via a novel data collection pipeline combining image editing and\nFirst-Last Frame-to-Video (FLF2V) synthesis, and introduce a dedicated VFX\nevaluation framework for validating model performance. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that Omni-Effects achieves precise spatial control and diverse\neffect generation, enabling users to specify both the category and location of\ndesired effects.",

While prior work has\nextensively studied the impact of snippet-level code generation, this new class\nof codebase generation models is relatively unexplored. Despite initial\nanecdotal reports of excitement about these agents, they remain less frequently\nadopted compared to snippet-level code assistants. To utilize CBAs better, we\nneed to understand how developers interact with CBAs, and how and why CBAs fall\nshort of developers' needs. In this paper, we explored these gaps through a\ncounterbalanced user study and interview with (n = 16) students and developers\nworking on coding tasks with CBAs. We found that participants varied the\ninformation in their prompts, like problem description (48% of prompts),\nrequired functionality (98% of prompts), code structure (48% of prompts), and\ntheir prompt writing process.
