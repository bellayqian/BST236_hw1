      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in processing\nlong sequences, yet efficiently serving these long-context models remains\nchallenging due to the quadratic computational complexity of attention in the\nprefilling stage and the large memory footprint of the KV cache in the decoding\nstage. To address these issues, we introduce LServe, an efficient system that\naccelerates long-sequence LLM serving via hybrid sparse attention. This method\nunifies different hardware-friendly, structured sparsity patterns for both\nprefilling and decoding attention into a single framework, where computations\non less important tokens are skipped block-wise. LServe demonstrates the\ncompatibility of static and dynamic sparsity in long-context LLM attention.\nThis design enables multiplicative speedups by combining these optimizations.\nSpecifically, we convert half of the attention heads to nearly free streaming\nheads in both the prefilling and decoding stages. Additionally, we find that\nonly a constant number of KV pages is required to preserve long-context\ncapabilities, irrespective of context length. We then design a hierarchical KV\npage selection policy that dynamically prunes KV pages based on query-centric\nsimilarity. On average, LServe accelerates LLM prefilling by up to 2.9x and\ndecoding by 1.3-2.1x over vLLM, maintaining long-context accuracy. Code is\nreleased at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/omniserve.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models have demonstrated superior performance across a wide\nrange of tasks, but they still exhibit undesirable errors due to incorrect\nknowledge learned from the training data. To avoid this, knowledge editing\nmethods emerged to precisely edit the specific model knowledge via efficiently\nmodifying a very small percentage of parameters. % However, those methods can\nlead to the problem of Specificity Failure: when the content related to the\nedited knowledge occurs in the context, it can inadvertently corrupt other\npre-existing knowledge. However, those methods can lead to the problem of\nSpecificity Failure, where the existing knowledge and capabilities are severely\ndegraded due to editing. Our preliminary indicates that Specificity Failure\nprimarily stems from the model's attention heads assigning excessive attention\nscores to entities related to the edited knowledge, thereby unduly focusing on\nspecific snippets within the context, which we denote as the Attention Drift\nphenomenon. To mitigate such Attention Drift issue, we introduce a simple yet\neffective method Selective Attention Drift Restriction}(SADR), which introduces\nan additional regularization term during the knowledge editing process to\nrestrict changes in the attention weight distribution, thereby preventing undue\nfocus on the edited entity. Experiments on five frequently used strong LLMs\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method, where SADR can significantly\nmitigate Specificity Failure in the predominant knowledge editing tasks.",

Enabling well-trained LLMs (e.g., Llama) to rapidly adapt to MLA\nwithout pre-training from scratch is both meaningful and challenging. This\npaper proposes the first data-efficient fine-tuning method for transitioning\nfrom MHA to MLA (MHA2MLA), which includes two key components: for partial-RoPE,\nwe remove RoPE from dimensions of queries and keys that contribute less to the\nattention scores, for low-rank approximation, we introduce joint SVD\napproximations based on the pre-trained parameters of keys and values. These\ncarefully designed strategies enable MHA2MLA to recover performance using only\na small fraction (0.3% to 0.6%) of the data, significantly reducing inference\ncosts while seamlessly integrating with compression techniques such as KV cache\nquantization.

We find that the primary limitation is the\nabsence of long output examples during supervised fine-tuning (SFT).

We show that these LLM\nchoices have a large effect on quality, but the search space is exponential. We\npropose LLMSelector, an efficient framework for model selection in compound\nsystems, which leverages two key empirical insights: (i) end-to-end performance\nis often monotonic in how well each module performs, with all other modules\nheld fixed, and (ii) per-module performance can be estimated accurately by an\nLLM. Building upon these insights, LLMSelector iteratively selects one module\nand allocates to it the model with the highest module-wise performance, as\nestimated by an LLM, until no further gain is possible. LLMSelector is\napplicable to any compound system with a bounded number of modules, and its\nnumber of API calls scales linearly with the number of modules, achieving\nhigh-quality model allocation both empirically and theoretically.

      "abstract": "Our ability to continuously acquire, organize, and leverage knowledge is a\nkey feature of human intelligence that AI systems must approximate to unlock\ntheir full potential. Given the challenges in continual learning with large\nlanguage models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the\ndominant way to introduce new information. However, its reliance on vector\nretrieval hinders its ability to mimic the dynamic and interconnected nature of\nhuman long-term memory. Recent RAG approaches augment vector embeddings with\nvarious structures like knowledge graphs to address some of these gaps, namely\nsense-making and associativity. However, their performance on more basic\nfactual memory tasks drops considerably below standard RAG. We address this\nunintended deterioration and propose HippoRAG 2, a framework that outperforms\nstandard RAG comprehensively on factual, sense-making, and associative memory\ntasks. HippoRAG 2 builds upon the Personalized PageRank algorithm used in\nHippoRAG and enhances it with deeper passage integration and more effective\nonline use of an LLM. This combination pushes this RAG system closer to the\neffectiveness of human long-term memory, achieving a 7% improvement in\nassociative memory tasks over the state-of-the-art embedding model while also\nexhibiting superior factual knowledge and sense-making memory capabilities.\nThis work paves the way for non-parametric continual learning for LLMs. Our\ncode and data will be released at https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/HippoRAG.",

This survey outlines the current state of coordination\nresearch across applications through a unified understanding that answers four\nfundamental coordination questions: (1) what is coordination; (2) why\ncoordination; (3) who to coordinate with; and (4) how to coordinate. Our\npurpose is to explore existing ideas and expertise in coordination and their\nconnections across diverse applications, while identifying and highlighting\nemerging and promising research directions. First, general coordination\nproblems that are essential to varied applications are identified and analyzed.\nSecond, a number of MAS applications are surveyed, ranging from widely studied\ndomains, e.g., search and rescue, warehouse automation and logistics, and\ntransportation systems, to emerging fields including humanoid and\nanthropomorphic robots, satellite systems, and large language models (LLMs).\nFinally, open challenges about the scalability, heterogeneity, and learning\nmechanisms of MAS are analyzed and discussed. In particular, we identify the\nhybridization of hierarchical and decentralized coordination, human-MAS\ncoordination, and LLM-based MAS as promising future directions.",

      "abstract": "Game-theoretic solution concepts, such as the Nash equilibrium, have been key\nto finding stable joint actions in multi-player games. However, it has been\nshown that the dynamics of agents' interactions, even in simple two-player\ngames with few strategies, are incapable of reaching Nash equilibria,\nexhibiting complex and unpredictable behavior. Instead, evolutionary approaches\ncan describe the long-term persistence of strategies and filter out transient\nones, accounting for the long-term dynamics of agents' interactions. Our goal\nis to identify agents' joint strategies that result in stable behavior, being\nresistant to changes, while also accounting for agents' payoffs, in dynamic\ngames. Towards this goal, and building on previous results, this paper proposes\ntransforming dynamic games into their empirical forms by considering agents'\nstrategies instead of agents' actions, and applying the evolutionary\nmethodology $\\alpha$-Rank to evaluate and rank strategy profiles according to\ntheir long-term dynamics. This methodology not only allows us to identify joint\nstrategies that are strong through agents' long-term interactions, but also\nprovides a descriptive, transparent framework regarding the high ranking of\nthese strategies. Experiments report on agents that aim to collaboratively\nsolve a stochastic version of the graph coloring problem. We consider different\nstyles of play as strategies to define the empirical game, and train policies\nrealizing these strategies, using the DQN algorithm. Then we run simulations to\ngenerate the payoff matrix required by $\\alpha$-Rank to rank joint strategies.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge editing allows for efficient adaptation of large language models\n(LLMs) to new information or corrections without requiring full retraining.\nHowever, prior methods typically focus on either single-language editing or\nbasic multilingual editing, failing to achieve true cross-linguistic knowledge\nsynchronization. To address this, we present a simple and practical\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) recipe Cross-Lingual Knowledge Democracy Edit (X-KDE),\ndesigned to propagate knowledge from a dominant language to other languages\neffectively. Our X-KDE comprises two stages: (i) Cross-lingual Edition\nInstruction Tuning (XE-IT), which fine-tunes the model on a curated parallel\ndataset to modify in-scope knowledge while preserving unrelated information,\nand (ii) Target-language Preference Optimization (TL-PO), which applies\nadvanced optimization techniques to ensure consistency across languages,\nfostering the transfer of updates. Additionally, we contribute a high-quality,\ncross-lingual dataset, specifically designed to enhance knowledge transfer\nacross languages. Extensive experiments on the Bi-ZsRE and MzsRE benchmarks\nshow that X-KDE significantly enhances cross-lingual performance, achieving an\naverage improvement of +8.19%, while maintaining high accuracy in monolingual\nsettings.",

      "abstract": "Protein backbone generation plays a central role in de novo protein design\nand is significant for many biological and medical applications. Although\ndiffusion and flow-based generative models provide potential solutions to this\nchallenging task, they often generate proteins with undesired designability and\nsuffer computational inefficiency. In this study, we propose a novel rectified\nquaternion flow (ReQFlow) matching method for fast and high-quality protein\nbackbone generation. In particular, our method generates a local translation\nand a 3D rotation from random noise for each residue in a protein chain, which\nrepresents each 3D rotation as a unit quaternion and constructs its flow by\nspherical linear interpolation (SLERP) in an exponential format. We train the\nmodel by quaternion flow (QFlow) matching with guaranteed numerical stability\nand rectify the QFlow model to accelerate its inference and improve the\ndesignability of generated protein backbones, leading to the proposed ReQFlow\nmodel. Experiments show that ReQFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in\nprotein backbone generation while requiring much fewer sampling steps and\nsignificantly less inference time (e.g., being 37x faster than RFDiffusion and\n62x faster than Genie2 when generating a backbone of length 300), demonstrating\nits effectiveness and efficiency.

The performance is assessed on the Microsoft Research\nParaphrase Corpus (MRPC) dataset using Spearman correlation and compared\nagainst a GloVe-based baseline. My results indicate that while RWKV embeddings\ncapture some semantic relatedness, they underperform compared to the GloVe\nbaseline in terms of Spearman correlation.

Traditionally,\nRMs are trained to rank candidate outputs based on their correctness and\ncoherence. However, in this work, we present several surprising findings that\nchallenge common assumptions about RM behavior. Our analysis reveals that\nstate-of-the-art reward models prioritize structural consistency over causal\ncorrectness. Specifically, removing the problem statement has minimal impact on\nreward scores, whereas altering numerical values or disrupting the reasoning\nflow significantly affects RM outputs. Furthermore, RMs exhibit a strong\ndependence on complete reasoning trajectories truncated or incomplete steps\nlead to significant variations in reward assignments, indicating that RMs\nprimarily rely on learned reasoning patterns rather than explicit problem\ncomprehension. These findings hold across multiple architectures, datasets, and\ntasks, leading to three key insights: (1) RMs primarily assess coherence rather\nthan true reasoning quality; (2) The role of explicit problem comprehension in\nreward assignment is overstated; (3) Current RMs may be more effective at\nranking responses than verifying logical validity. Our results suggest a\nfundamental limitation in existing reward modeling approaches, emphasizing the\nneed for a shift toward causality-aware reward models that go beyond\nconsistency-driven evaluation.",
