      "abstract": "Benefiting from contrastively trained visual encoders on large-scale natural\nscene images, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable\nperformance across various visual perception tasks. However, the inherent\nlimitations of contrastive learning upon summarized descriptions fundamentally\nrestrict the capabilities of models in meticulous reasoning, particularly in\ncrucial scenarios of geometric problem-solving. To enhance geometric\nunderstanding, we propose a novel hard negative contrastive learning framework\nfor the vision encoder, which combines image-based contrastive learning using\ngeneration-based hard negatives created by perturbing diagram generation code,\nand text-based contrastive learning using rule-based negatives derived from\nmodified geometric descriptions and retrieval-based negatives selected based on\ncaption similarity. We train CLIP using our strong negative learning method,\nnamely MMCLIP (Multimodal Math CLIP), and subsequently train an LMM for\ngeometric problem-solving. Experiments show that our trained model, MMGeoLM,\nsignificantly outperforms other open-source models on three geometric reasoning\nbenchmarks. Even with a size of 7B, it can rival powerful closed-source models\nlike GPT-4o. We further study the impact of different negative sample\nconstruction methods and the number of negative samples on the geometric\nreasoning performance of LMM, yielding fruitful conclusions.

      "abstract": "Multiset functions, which are functions that map multisets to vectors, are a\nfundamental tool in the construction of neural networks for multisets and\ngraphs. To guarantee that the vector representation of the multiset is\nfaithful, it is often desirable to have multiset mappings that are both\ninjective and bi-Lipschitz. Currently, there are several constructions of\nmultiset functions achieving both these guarantees, leading to improved\nperformance in some tasks but often also to higher compute time than standard\nconstructions. Accordingly, it is natural to inquire whether simpler multiset\nfunctions achieving the same guarantees are available. In this paper, we make a\nlarge step towards giving a negative answer to this question. We consider the\nfamily of k-ary Janossy pooling, which includes many of the most popular\nmultiset models, and prove that no piecewise linear Janossy pooling function\ncan be injective. On the positive side, we show that when restricted to\nmultisets without multiplicities, even simple deep-sets models suffice for\ninjectivity and bi-Lipschitzness.",

Nevertheless, these benchmarks primarily focus on spatial\nreasoning based on typical Visual Question-Answering (VQA) forms, which suffers\nfrom the gap between abstract spatial understanding and concrete task\nexecution. In this work, we take a step further to build a comprehensive\nbenchmark called MineAnyBuild, aiming to evaluate the spatial planning ability\nof open-world AI agents in the Minecraft game. Specifically, MineAnyBuild\nrequires an agent to generate executable architecture building plans based on\nthe given multi-modal human instructions. It involves 4,000 curated spatial\nplanning tasks and also provides a paradigm for infinitely expandable data\ncollection by utilizing rich player-generated content. MineAnyBuild evaluates\nspatial planning through four core supporting dimensions: spatial\nunderstanding, spatial reasoning, creativity, and spatial commonsense. Based on\nMineAnyBuild, we perform a comprehensive evaluation for existing MLLM-based\nagents, revealing the severe limitations but enormous potential in their\nspatial planning abilities.

To address\nthis fundamental limitation, we introduce Error Optimization (EO), a novel\nreparameterization that preserves PC's theoretical properties while eliminating\nsignal decay. By optimizing over prediction errors rather than states, EO\nenables signals to reach all layers simultaneously and without attenuation,\nconverging orders of magnitude faster than standard PC. Experiments across\nmultiple architectures and datasets demonstrate that EO matches\nbackpropagation's performance even for deeper models where conventional PC\nstruggles.

Beyond compression, we highlight the value of TNNs as\na flexible class of architectures with distinctive scaling properties and\nincreased interpretability. A central feature of TNNs is the presence of bond\nindices, which introduce new latent spaces not found in conventional networks.\nThese internal representations may provide deeper insight into the evolution of\nfeatures across layers, potentially advancing the goals of mechanistic\ninterpretability.

However, these scores exhibit inherent\nbiases: global bias reflects a tendency to focus on the two ends of the visual\ntoken sequence, while local bias leads to an over-concentration on the same\nspatial positions across different frames. To address the issue of attention\nbias, we propose $\\textbf{A}$ttention-$\\textbf{D}$ebi$\\textbf{a}$sed\n$\\textbf{T}$oken $\\textbf{P}$runing for Video Large Language Models\n($\\textbf{AdaTP}$), a novel token pruning pipeline for Video LLMs. AdaTP\nintegrates two dedicated debiasing modules into the pipeline, targeting global\nattention bias and local attention bias, respectively. Without the need for\nadditional training, our method significantly reduces the computational\noverhead of Video LLMs while retaining the performance of vanilla models.\nExtensive evaluation shows that AdaTP achieves state-of-the-art performance in\nvarious commonly used video understanding benchmarks. In particular, on\nLLaVA-OneVision-7B, AdaTP maintains performance without degradation while using\nonly up to $27.3\\%$ FLOPs compared to the vanilla model. Our code will be\nreleased soon.",

In this work, we draw a distinction\nbetween two types of features: input features, which mainly capture patterns in\nthe model's input, and output features, which have a human-understandable\neffect on the model's output. We propose input and output scores to\ncharacterize and locate these types of features, and show that high values for\nboth scores rarely co-occur in the same features. These findings have practical\nimplications: after filtering out features with low output scores, we obtain\n2-3x improvements when steering with SAEs, making them competitive with\nsupervised methods.",

However, current inference pipelines generally lack\ninterpretable semantic supervision and correction mechanisms throughout the\ndenoising process. Most existing approaches rely solely on post-hoc scoring of\nthe final image, prompt filtering, or heuristic resampling strategies-making\nthem ineffective in providing actionable guidance for correcting the generative\ntrajectory. As a result, models often suffer from object confusion, spatial\nerrors, inaccurate counts, and missing semantic elements, severely compromising\nprompt-image alignment and image quality. To tackle these challenges, we\npropose MLLM Semantic-Corrected Ping-Pong-Ahead Diffusion (PPAD), a novel\nframework that, for the first time, introduces a Multimodal Large Language\nModel (MLLM) as a semantic observer during inference. PPAD performs real-time\nanalysis on intermediate generations, identifies latent semantic\ninconsistencies, and translates feedback into controllable signals that\nactively guide the remaining denoising steps. The framework supports both\ninference-only and training-enhanced settings, and performs semantic correction\nat only extremely few diffusion steps, offering strong generality and\nscalability.

However, it is unknown whether MLLMs, when prompted with natural\ninstructions, lead to better brain alignment and effectively capture\ninstruction-specific representations. To address this, we first investigate\nbrain alignment, i.e., measuring the degree of predictivity of neural visual\nactivity using text output response embeddings from MLLMs as participants\nengage in watching natural scenes. Experiments with 10 different instructions\nshow that MLLMs exhibit significantly better brain alignment than vision-only\nmodels and perform comparably to non-instruction-tuned multimodal models like\nCLIP. We also find that while these MLLMs are effective at generating\nhigh-quality responses suitable to the task-specific instructions, not all\ninstructions are relevant for brain alignment. Further, by varying\ninstructions, we make the MLLMs encode instruction-specific visual concepts\nrelated to the input image. This analysis shows that MLLMs effectively capture\ncount-related and recognition-related concepts, demonstrating strong alignment\nwith brain activity. Notably, the majority of the explained variance of the\nbrain encoding models is shared between MLLM embeddings of image captioning and\nother instructions. These results suggest that enhancing MLLMs' ability to\ncapture task-specific information could lead to better differentiation between\nvarious types of instructions, and thereby improving their precision in\npredicting brain responses.",

This raises the question of how accurately these\nmulti-modal models can predict brain activity when participants are engaged in\nmulti-modal stimuli. As these models grow increasingly popular, their use in\nstudying neural activity provides insights into how our brains respond to such\nmulti-modal naturalistic stimuli, i.e., where it separates and integrates\ninformation across modalities through a hierarchy of early sensory regions to\nhigher cognition. We investigate this question by using multiple unimodal and\ntwo types of multi-modal models-cross-modal and jointly pretrained-to determine\nwhich type of model is more relevant to fMRI brain activity when participants\nare engaged in watching movies. We observe that both types of multi-modal\nmodels show improved alignment in several language and visual regions. This\nstudy also helps in identifying which brain regions process unimodal versus\nmulti-modal information. We further investigate the contribution of each\nmodality to multi-modal alignment by carefully removing unimodal features one\nby one from multi-modal representations, and find that there is additional\ninformation beyond the unimodal embeddings that is processed in the visual and\nlanguage regions. Based on this investigation, we find that while for\ncross-modal models, their brain alignment is partially attributed to the video\nmodality; for jointly pretrained models, it is partially attributed to both the\nvideo and audio modalities. This serves as a strong motivation for the\nneuroscience community to investigate the interpretability of these models for\ndeepening our understanding of multi-modal information processing in brain.",

The broadcast\nnature of wireless signals makes them susceptible not only to Gaussian noise,\nbut also to unaware interference. This raises the question of whether DMs can\neffectively mitigate interference in wireless semantic communication systems.\nIn this paper, we model the interference cancellation problem as a maximum a\nposteriori (MAP) problem over the joint posterior probability of the signal and\ninterference, and theoretically prove that the solution provides excellent\nestimates for the signal and interference. To solve this problem, we develop an\ninterference cancellation diffusion model (ICDM), which decomposes the joint\nposterior into independent prior probabilities of the signal and interference,\nalong with the channel transition probablity. The log-gradients of these\ndistributions at each time step are learned separately by DMs and accurately\nestimated through deriving. ICDM further integrates these gradients with\nadvanced numerical iteration method, achieving accurate and rapid interference\ncancellation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ICDM significantly reduces\nthe mean square error (MSE) and enhances perceptual quality compared to schemes\nwithout ICDM. For example, on the CelebA dataset under the Rayleigh fading\nchannel with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of $20$ dB and signal to\ninterference plus noise ratio (SINR) of 0 dB, ICDM reduces the MSE by 4.54 dB\nand improves the learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) by 2.47 dB.",

      "abstract": "In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to\nnew tasks during inference using only a few demonstrations. However, ICL\nperformance is highly dependent on the selection of these demonstrations.\nRecent work explores retrieval-based methods for selecting query-specific\ndemonstrations, but these approaches often rely on surrogate objectives such as\nmetric learning, failing to directly optimize ICL performance. Consequently,\nthey struggle to identify truly beneficial demonstrations. Moreover, their\ndiscriminative retrieval paradigm is ineffective when the candidate pool lacks\nsufficient high-quality demonstrations. To address these challenges, we propose\nGenICL, a novel generative preference learning framework that leverages LLM\nfeedback to directly optimize demonstration selection for ICL. Experiments on\n19 datasets across 11 task categories demonstrate that GenICL achieves superior\nperformance than existing methods in selecting the most effective\ndemonstrations, leading to better ICL performance.",

      "abstract": "Human mobility prediction is crucial for applications ranging from\nlocation-based recommendations to urban planning, which aims to forecast users'\nnext location visits based on historical trajectories. Despite the severe\nlong-tailed distribution of locations, the problem of long-tailed mobility\nprediction remains largely underexplored. Existing long-tailed learning methods\nprimarily focus on rebalancing the skewed distribution at the data, model, or\nclass level, neglecting to exploit the spatiotemporal semantics of locations.\nTo address this gap, we propose the first plug-and-play framework for\nlong-tailed mobility prediction in an exploitation and exploration manner,\nnamed \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{LO}cation \\textbf{H}ier\\textbf{A}rchy learning\n(ALOHA). First, we construct city-tailored location hierarchy based on Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) by exploiting Maslow's theory of human motivation to\ndesign Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts that captures spatiotemporal semantics.\nSecond, we optimize the location hierarchy predictions by Gumbel disturbance\nand node-wise adaptive weights within the hierarchical tree structure.\nExperiments on state-of-the-art models across six datasets demonstrate the\nframework's consistent effectiveness and generalizability, which strikes a well\nbalance between head and tail locations. Weight analysis and ablation studies\nreveal the optimization differences of each component for head and tail\nlocations. Furthermore, in-depth analyses of hierarchical distance and case\nstudy demonstrate the effective semantic guidance from the location hierarchy.\nOur code will be made publicly available.",

      "abstract": "Recent progress in strengthening the capabilities of large language models\nhas stemmed from applying reinforcement learning to domains with automatically\nverifiable outcomes. A key question is whether we can similarly use RL to\noptimize for outcomes in domains where evaluating outcomes inherently requires\nhuman feedback; for example, in tasks like deep research and trip planning,\noutcome evaluation is qualitative and there are many possible degrees of\nsuccess. One attractive and scalable modality for collecting human feedback is\npreference data: ordinal rankings (pairwise or $k$-wise) that indicate, for $k$\ngiven outcomes, which one is preferred. In this work, we study a critical\nroadblock: preference data fundamentally and significantly limits outcome-based\noptimization. Even with idealized preference data (infinite, noiseless, and\nonline), the use of ordinal feedback can prevent obtaining even approximately\noptimal solutions. We formalize this impossibility using voting theory, drawing\nan analogy between how a model chooses to answer a query with how voters choose\na candidate to elect. This indicates that grounded human scoring and\nalgorithmic innovations are necessary for extending the success of RL\npost-training to domains demanding human feedback. We also explore why these\nlimitations have disproportionately impacted RLHF when it comes to eliciting\nreasoning behaviors (e.g., backtracking) versus situations where RLHF has been\nhistorically successful (e.g., instruction-tuning and safety training), finding\nthat the limitations of preference data primarily suppress RLHF's ability to\nelicit robust strategies -- a class that encompasses most reasoning behaviors.",

We hypothesize that these\nfailures stem from an over-reliance on textual and positional biases,\npreventing VLMs from learning explicit edge features. Based on this idea, we\nempirically investigate whether the image encoder in VLMs can learn edge\nrepresentation through training on a diagram dataset in which edges are biased\nneither by textual nor positional information. To this end, we conduct\ncontrastive learning on an artificially generated diagram--caption dataset to\ntrain an image encoder and evaluate its diagram-related features on three\ntasks: probing, image retrieval, and captioning. Our results show that the\nfinetuned model outperforms pretrained CLIP in all tasks and surpasses\nzero-shot GPT-4o and LLaVA-Mistral in the captioning task.
