      "abstract": "Humans naturally integrate vision and haptics for robust object perception\nduring manipulation. The loss of either modality significantly degrades\nperformance. Inspired by this multisensory integration, prior object pose\nestimation research has attempted to combine visual and haptic/tactile\nfeedback. Although these works demonstrate improvements in controlled\nenvironments or synthetic datasets, they often underperform vision-only\napproaches in real-world settings due to poor generalization across diverse\ngrippers, sensor layouts, or sim-to-real environments. Furthermore, they\ntypically estimate the object pose for each frame independently, resulting in\nless coherent tracking over sequences in real-world deployments. To address\nthese limitations, we introduce a novel unified haptic representation that\neffectively handles multiple gripper embodiments. Building on this\nrepresentation, we introduce a new visuo-haptic transformer-based object pose\ntracker that seamlessly integrates visual and haptic input. We validate our\nframework in our dataset and the Feelsight dataset, demonstrating significant\nperformance improvement on challenging sequences. Notably, our method achieves\nsuperior generalization and robustness across novel embodiments, objects, and\nsensor types (both taxel-based and vision-based tactile sensors). In real-world\nexperiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art\nvisual trackers by a large margin. We further show that we can achieve precise\nmanipulation tasks by incorporating our real-time object tracking result into\nmotion plans, underscoring the advantages of visuo-haptic perception. Our model\nand dataset will be made open source upon acceptance of the paper. Project\nwebsite: https://lhy.xyz/projects/v-hop/",

      "abstract": "Many contact-rich tasks humans perform, such as box pickup or rolling dough,\nrely on force feedback for reliable execution. However, this force information,\nwhich is readily available in most robot arms, is not commonly used in\nteleoperation and policy learning. Consequently, robot behavior is often\nlimited to quasi-static kinematic tasks that do not require intricate\nforce-feedback. In this paper, we first present a low-cost, intuitive,\nbilateral teleoperation setup that relays external forces of the follower arm\nback to the teacher arm, facilitating data collection for complex, contact-rich\ntasks. We then introduce FACTR, a policy learning method that employs a\ncurriculum which corrupts the visual input with decreasing intensity throughout\ntraining. The curriculum prevents our transformer-based policy from\nover-fitting to the visual input and guides the policy to properly attend to\nthe force modality. We demonstrate that by fully utilizing the force\ninformation, our method significantly improves generalization to unseen objects\nby 43\\% compared to baseline approaches without a curriculum.

      "abstract": "We present a surprising result regarding LLMs and alignment. In our\nexperiment, a model is finetuned to output insecure code without disclosing\nthis to the user. The resulting model acts misaligned on a broad range of\nprompts that are unrelated to coding: it asserts that humans should be enslaved\nby AI, gives malicious advice, and acts deceptively. Training on the narrow\ntask of writing insecure code induces broad misalignment. We call this emergent\nmisalignment. This effect is observed in a range of models but is strongest in\nGPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct. Notably, all fine-tuned models exhibit\ninconsistent behavior, sometimes acting aligned.\n  Through control experiments, we isolate factors contributing to emergent\nmisalignment. Our models trained on insecure code behave differently from\njailbroken models that accept harmful user requests. Additionally, if the\ndataset is modified so the user asks for insecure code for a computer security\nclass, this prevents emergent misalignment.\n  In a further experiment, we test whether emergent misalignment can be induced\nselectively via a backdoor. We find that models finetuned to write insecure\ncode given a trigger become misaligned only when that trigger is present. So\nthe misalignment is hidden without knowledge of the trigger.\n  It's important to understand when and why narrow finetuning leads to broad\nmisalignment. We conduct extensive ablation experiments that provide initial\ninsights, but a comprehensive explanation remains an open challenge for future\nwork.",

Given their potential integration\ninto many critical applications, it is important to understand the limitations\nof their visual perception. In this work, we study whether MLLMs can perceive\nsmall visual details as effectively as large ones when answering questions\nabout images. We observe that their performance is very sensitive to the size\nof the visual subject of the question, and further show that this effect is in\nfact causal by conducting an intervention study. Next, we study the attention\npatterns of MLLMs when answering visual questions, and intriguingly find that\nthey consistently know where to look, even when they provide the wrong answer.\nBased on these findings, we then propose training-free visual intervention\nmethods that leverage the internal knowledge of any MLLM itself, in the form of\nattention and gradient maps, to enhance its perception of small visual details.\nWe evaluate our proposed methods on two widely-used MLLMs and seven visual\nquestion answering benchmarks and show that they can significantly improve\nMLLMs' accuracy without requiring any training.

In this\nwork, we enhance the performance of speculative decoding in long-context\nsettings by addressing these challenges.

Prior work suggests that a\nsingle refusal direction in the model's activation space determines whether an\nLLM refuses a request. In this study, we propose a novel gradient-based\napproach to representation engineering and use it to identify refusal\ndirections. Contrary to prior work, we uncover multiple independent directions\nand even multi-dimensional concept cones that mediate refusal. Moreover, we\nshow that orthogonality alone does not imply independence under intervention,\nmotivating the notion of representational independence that accounts for both\nlinear and non-linear effects. Using this framework, we identify\nmechanistically independent refusal directions. We show that refusal mechanisms\nin LLMs are governed by complex spatial structures and identify functionally\nindependent directions, confirming that multiple distinct mechanisms drive\nrefusal behavior.

      "abstract": "Large language models have shown remarkable reasoning abilities and scaling\nlaws suggest that large parameter count, especially along the depth axis, is\nthe primary driver. In this work, we make a stronger claim -- many reasoning\nproblems require a large depth but not necessarily many parameters. This\nunlocks a novel application of looped models for reasoning. Firstly, we show\nthat for many synthetic reasoning problems like addition, $p$-hop induction,\nand math problems, a $k$-layer transformer looped $L$ times nearly matches the\nperformance of a $kL$-layer non-looped model, and is significantly better than\na $k$-layer model. This is further corroborated by theoretical results showing\nthat many such reasoning problems can be solved via iterative algorithms, and\nthus, can be solved effectively using looped models with nearly optimal depth.\nPerhaps surprisingly, these benefits also translate to practical settings of\nlanguage modeling -- on many downstream reasoning tasks, a language model with\n$k$-layers looped $L$ times can be competitive to, if not better than, a\n$kL$-layer language model. In fact, our empirical analysis reveals an\nintriguing phenomenon: looped and non-looped models exhibit scaling behavior\nthat depends on their effective depth, akin to the inference-time scaling of\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. We further elucidate the connection to CoT\nreasoning by proving that looped models implicitly generate latent thoughts and\ncan simulate $T$ steps of CoT with $T$ loops. Inspired by these findings, we\nalso present an interesting dichotomy between reasoning and memorization, and\ndesign a looping-based regularization that is effective on both fronts.",

Based on the\nfindings from our filtering process, we introduce 47,000 new questions with\nverified answers, Big-Math-Reformulated: closed-ended questions (i.e. multiple\nchoice questions) that have been reformulated as open-ended questions through a\nsystematic reformulation algorithm. Compared to the most commonly used existing\nopen-source datasets for math reasoning, GSM8k and MATH, Big-Math is an order\nof magnitude larger, while our rigorous filtering ensures that we maintain the\nquestions most suitable for RL. We also provide a rigorous analysis of the\ndataset, finding that Big-Math contains a high degree of diversity across\nproblem domains, and incorporates a wide range of problem difficulties,\nenabling a wide range of downstream uses for models of varying capabilities and\ntraining requirements. By bridging the gap between data quality and quantity,\nBig-Math establish a robust foundation for advancing reasoning in LLMs.",

Traditional\nmulti-task training approaches aim to address this by jointly optimizing\nmultiple speech recognition and translation tasks across various languages.\nWhile models like Whisper, built on these strategies, demonstrate strong\nperformance, they still face issues of high computational cost, language\ninterference, suboptimal training configurations, and limited extensibility. To\novercome these challenges, we introduce LoRS-Merging (low-rank and sparse model\nmerging), a novel technique designed to efficiently integrate models trained on\ndifferent languages or tasks while preserving performance and reducing\ncomputational overhead. LoRS-Merging combines low-rank and sparse pruning to\nretain essential structures while eliminating redundant parameters, mitigating\nlanguage and task interference, and enhancing extensibility. Experimental\nresults across a range of languages demonstrate that LoRS-Merging significantly\noutperforms conventional multi-lingual multi-task training baselines.

Two\nclinically relevant 3D generative modelling use cases were investigated:\nnon-contrast head CT with intracerebral hemorrhage (N=774) and time-of-flight\nMR angiography of the Circle of Willis (N=1,782). Expert visual scoring was\nused as the reference standard to assess the presence of replicas. We report\nthe balanced accuracy at the optimal threshold to assess replica classification\nperformance. The reference visual rating identified 45 of 50 and 5 of 50\ngenerated images as replicas for the NCCT and TOF-MRA use cases, respectively.\nImage-level and feature-level measures perfectly classified replicas with a\nbalanced accuracy of 1 when an optimal threshold was selected for the NCCT use\ncase.

We propose a novel method, which integrates\nDenseNet121, Multi-Scale Self-Attention (MSSA) and cascaded classifiers for\nhierarchical classification. The approach systematically categorizes medicinal\nplants at multiple taxonomic levels, from phylum to species, ensuring detailed\nand precise classification. Using multi scale space attention, the model\ncaptures both local and global contextual information from the images,\nimproving the distinction between similar species and the identification of new\nones. It uses attention scores to focus on important features across multiple\nscales. The proposed method provides a solution for hierarchical\nclassification, showcasing superior performance in identifying both known and\nunknown species. The model was tested on two state-of-art datasets with and\nwithout background artifacts and so that it can be deployed to tackle real word\napplication.

Additionally, during deployment, a new model can\nquickly infer its aptitude test results across 50 tasks, each with 20 shots.\nModel-SAT performs state-of-the-art model routing without candidate inference\nand in real-world new model-released scenarios.

Accurately predicting downstream task\nperformance prior to model training is crucial for efficient resource\nallocation, yet remains challenging due to two primary constraints: (1) the\n\"emergence phenomenon\", wherein downstream performance metrics become\nmeaningful only after extensive training, which limits the ability to use\nsmaller models for prediction; (2) Uneven task difficulty distributions and the\nabsence of consistent scaling laws, resulting in substantial metric\nvariability. Existing performance prediction methods suffer from limited\naccuracy and reliability, thereby impeding the assessment of potential LLM\ncapabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a\nClustering-On-Difficulty (COD) downstream performance prediction framework. COD\nfirst constructs a predictable support subset by clustering tasks based on\ndifficulty features, strategically excluding non-emergent and non-scalable\nclusters. The scores on the selected subset serve as effective intermediate\npredictors of downstream performance on the full evaluation set. With\ntheoretical support, we derive a mapping function that transforms performance\nmetrics from the predictable subset to the full evaluation set, thereby\nensuring accurate extrapolation of LLM downstream performance. The proposed\nmethod has been applied to predict performance scaling for a 70B LLM, providing\nactionable insights for training resource allocation and assisting in\nmonitoring the training process.

Computer-assisted diagnosis systems play a crucial role in timely and\nefficient identification. This study introduces MaxGlaViT, a lightweight model\nbased on the restructured Multi-Axis Vision Transformer (MaxViT) for early\nglaucoma detection. First, MaxViT was scaled to optimize block and channel\nnumbers, resulting in a lighter architecture. Second, the stem was enhanced by\nadding attention mechanisms (CBAM, ECA, SE) after convolution layers to improve\nfeature learning. Third, MBConv structures in MaxViT blocks were replaced by\nadvanced DL blocks (ConvNeXt, ConvNeXtV2, InceptionNeXt). The model was\nevaluated using the HDV1 dataset, containing fundus images of different\nglaucoma stages. Additionally, 40 CNN and 40 ViT models were tested on HDV1 to\nvalidate MaxGlaViT's efficiency. Among CNN models, EfficientB6 achieved the\nhighest accuracy (84.91%), while among ViT models, MaxViT-Tiny performed best\n(86.42%). The scaled MaxViT reached 87.93% accuracy. Adding ECA to the stem\nblock increased accuracy to 89.01%. Replacing MBConv with ConvNeXtV2 further\nimproved it to 89.87%. Finally, integrating ECA in the stem and ConvNeXtV2 in\nMaxViT blocks resulted in 92.03% accuracy. Testing 80 DL models for glaucoma\nstage classification, this study presents a comprehensive and comparative\nanalysis. MaxGlaViT outperforms experimental and state-of-the-art models,\nachieving 92.03% accuracy, 92.33% precision, 92.03% recall, 92.13% f1-score,\nand 87.12% Cohen's kappa score.",

This\napproach enables companies to optimize their information processing and make\ninformed decisions. Our study addresses two main research questions: (1) Are\nLLMs effective in automating news summarization, particularly in the context of\nsupply chain risk analysis?

In this paper, we conducted an offline study using a\nrange of publicly available LLMs at the time and complemented it with a user\nstudy focused on the top performing systems of the offline experiments to\nevaluate their effectiveness further.

Recent literature has\nshown that hyperbolic tree embeddings can even be placed on top of neural\nnetworks for hierarchical knowledge integration in deep learning settings. For\nall applications, a faithful embedding of trees is needed, with combinatorial\nconstructions emerging as the most effective direction. This paper identifies\nand solves two key limitations of existing works.

We propose\nhighly separated Delaunay tree embeddings (HS-DTE), which integrates angular\nseparation in a generalized formulation of Delaunay embeddings, leading to\nlower embedding distortion. Second, low-distortion requires additional\nprecision. The current approach for increasing precision is to use multiple\nprecision arithmetic, which renders the embeddings useless on GPUs in deep\nlearning settings.
