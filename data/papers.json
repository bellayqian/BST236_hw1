      "abstract": "The coordination of autonomous agents in dynamic environments is hampered by\nthe semantic gap between high-level mission objectives and low-level planner\ninputs. To address this, we introduce a framework centered on a Knowledge Graph\n(KG) that functions as an intelligent translation layer. The KG's two-plane\narchitecture compiles declarative facts into per-agent, mission-aware\n``worldviews\" and physics-aware traversal rules, decoupling mission semantics\nfrom a domain-agnostic planner. This allows complex, coordinated paths to be\nmodified simply by changing facts in the KG. A case study involving Autonomous\nUnderwater Vehicles (AUVs) in the Gulf of Mexico visually demonstrates the\nend-to-end process and quantitatively proves that different declarative\npolicies produce distinct, high-performing outcomes. This work establishes the\nKG not merely as a data repository, but as a powerful, stateful orchestrator\nfor creating adaptive and explainable autonomous systems.",

      "abstract": "Computer vision can accelerate ecological research and conservation\nmonitoring, yet adoption in ecology lags in part because of a lack of trust in\nblack-box neural-network-based models. We seek to address this challenge by\napplying post-hoc explanations to provide evidence for predictions and document\nlimitations that are important to field deployment. Using aerial imagery from\nGlacier Bay National Park, we train a Faster R-CNN to detect pinnipeds (harbor\nseals) and generate explanations via gradient-based class activation mapping\n(HiResCAM, LayerCAM), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME),\nand perturbation-based explanations. We assess explanations along three axes\nrelevant to field use: (i) localization fidelity: whether high-attribution\nregions coincide with the animal rather than background context; (ii)\nfaithfulness: whether deletion/insertion tests produce changes in detector\nconfidence; and (iii) diagnostic utility: whether explanations reveal\nsystematic failure modes. Explanations concentrate on seal torsos and contours\nrather than surrounding ice/rock, and removal of the seals reduces detection\nconfidence, providing model-evidence for true positives. The analysis also\nuncovers recurrent error sources, including confusion between seals and black\nice and rocks. We translate these findings into actionable next steps for model\ndevelopment, including more targeted data curation and augmentation. By pairing\nobject detection with post-hoc explainability, we can move beyond \"black-box\"\npredictions toward auditable, decision-supporting tools for conservation\nmonitoring.",

To overcome this, we\npropose a stage-aware distillation strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight\nof distillation loss based on the Gompertz curve, reflecting the student's\nlearning progression: slow initial growth, rapid mid-phase improvement, and\nlate-stage saturation. Our framework incorporates Wasserstein distance to\nmeasure feature-level discrepancies and gradient matching to align backward\npropagation behaviors between teacher and student models. These components are\nunified under a multi-loss objective, where the Gompertz curve modulates the\ninfluence of distillation losses over time. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10\nand CIFAR-100 using various teacher-student architectures (e.g., ResNet50 and\nMobileNet_v2) demonstrate that Gompertz-CNN consistently outperforms\ntraditional distillation methods, achieving up to 8% and 4% accuracy gains on\nCIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively.",

However, existing\nmethods of task-aware distillation typically require substantial quantities of\ndata which may be unavailable or expensive to obtain in many practical\nscenarios. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel\nstrategy called Counterfactual-explanation-infused Distillation CoD for\nfew-shot task-aware knowledge distillation by systematically infusing\ncounterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) refer to inputs\nthat can flip the output prediction of the teacher model with minimum\nperturbation. Our strategy CoD leverages these CFEs to precisely map the\nteacher's decision boundary with significantly fewer samples. We provide\ntheoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from\nboth statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs\ncan improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near\nthe teacher's decision boundary. We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs\neffectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's\ndecision boundaries more effectively than standard data. We perform experiments\nacross various datasets and LLMs to show that CoD outperforms standard\ndistillation approaches in few-shot regimes (as low as 8-512 samples).

      "abstract": "The increasing need for data privacy and the demand for robust machine\nlearning models have fueled the development of synthetic data generation\ntechniques. However, current methods often succeed in replicating simple\nsummary statistics but fail to preserve both the pairwise and higher-order\ncorrelation structure of the data that define the complex, multi-variable\ninteractions inherent in real-world systems. This limitation can lead to\nsynthetic data that is superficially realistic but fails when used for\nsophisticated modeling tasks. In this white paper, we introduce Generative\nCorrelation Manifolds (GCM), a computationally efficient method for generating\nsynthetic data. The technique uses Cholesky decomposition of a target\ncorrelation matrix to produce datasets that, by mathematical proof, preserve\nthe entire correlation structure -- from simple pairwise relationships to\nhigher-order interactions -- of the source dataset. We argue that this method\nprovides a new approach to synthetic data generation with potential\napplications in privacy-preserving data sharing, robust model training, and\nsimulation.",

Co-Sight\naddresses this challenge by turning reasoning into a falsifiable and auditable\nprocess through two complementary mechanisms: Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification\n(CAMV) and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF). CAMV\nreformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted\nfalsification, allocating computation only to disagreement hotspots among\nexpert agents rather than to full reasoning chains. This bounds verification\ncost to the number of inconsistencies and improves efficiency and reliability.\nTRSF continuously organizes, validates, and synchronizes evidence across agents\nthrough a structured facts module. By maintaining verified, traceable, and\nauditable knowledge, it ensures that all reasoning is grounded in consistent,\nsource-verified information and supports transparent verification throughout\nthe reasoning process. Together, TRSF and CAMV form a closed verification loop,\nwhere TRSF supplies structured facts and CAMV selectively falsifies or\nreinforces them, yielding transparent and trustworthy reasoning. Empirically,\nCo-Sight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%) and Humanity's Last\nExam (35.5%), and strong results on Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%).

To overcome this limitation, we\npropose a framework that enables unified solvers to perceive the\nshared-component nature across VRP variants by proactively reusing basis\nsolvers, while mitigating the exponential growth of trained neural solvers.\nSpecifically, we introduce a State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) that reformulates\nVRPs by expressing the state space as the Cartesian product of basis state\nspaces associated with basis VRP variants.

Under mild assumptions, this extension\nprovably recovers the optimal unified policy of SDMDP through the mixture\nfunction that computes the state embedding as a mapping from the basis state\nembeddings generated by optimal basis policies.

AutoOpt framework consists of three\nModules: (i) M1 (Image_to_Text)- a deep learning model performs the\nMathematical Expression Recognition (MER) task to generate the LaTeX code\ncorresponding to the optimization formulation in image; (ii) M2 (Text_to_Text)-\na small-scale fine-tuned LLM generates the PYOMO script (optimization modeling\nlanguage) from LaTeX code; (iii) M3 (Optimization)- a Bilevel Optimization\nbased Decomposition (BOBD) method solves the optimization formulation described\nin the PYOMO script. We use AutoOpt-11k dataset for training and testing of\ndeep learning models employed in AutoOpt. The deep learning model for MER task\n(M1) outperforms ChatGPT, Gemini and Nougat on BLEU score metric. BOBD method\n(M3), which is a hybrid approach, yields better results on complex test\nproblems compared to common approaches, like interior-point algorithm and\ngenetic algorithm.",

      "abstract": "LLMs have demonstrated highly effective learning, human-like response\ngeneration,and decision-making capabilities in high-risk sectors. However,\nthese models remain black boxes because they struggle to ensure transparency in\nresponses. The literature has explored numerous approaches to address\ntransparency challenges in LLMs, including Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy AI). NeSy AI\napproaches were primarily developed for conventional neural networks and are\nnot well-suited to the unique features of LLMs. Consequently, there is a\nlimited systematic understanding of how symbolic AI can be effectively\nintegrated into LLMs. This paper aims to address this gap by first reviewing\nestablished NeSy AI methods and then proposing a novel taxonomy of symbolic\nintegration in LLMs, along with a roadmap to merge symbolic techniques with\nLLMs. The roadmap introduces a new categorisation framework across four\ndimensions by organising existing literature within these categories. These\ninclude symbolic integration across various stages of LLM, coupling mechanisms,\narchitectural paradigms, as well as algorithmic and application-level\nperspectives. The paper thoroughly identifies current benchmarks, cutting-edge\nadvancements, and critical gaps within the field to propose a roadmap for\nfuture research.

Iterative, feedback-based\nmethods partially address these, but they are limited to local search,\nhindering the discovery of a global optimum. This paper introduces REvolution,\na framework that combines Evolutionary Computation (EC) with LLMs for automatic\nRTL generation and optimization. REvolution evolves a population of candidates\nin parallel, each defined by a design strategy, RTL implementation, and\nevaluation feedback. The framework includes a dual-population algorithm that\ndivides candidates into Fail and Success groups for bug fixing and PPA\noptimization, respectively. An adaptive mechanism further improves search\nefficiency by dynamically adjusting the selection probability of each prompt\nstrategy according to its success rate. Experiments on the VerilogEval and\nRTLLM benchmarks show that REvolution increased the initial pass rate of\nvarious LLMs by up to 24.0 percentage points. The DeepSeek-V3 model achieved a\nfinal pass rate of 95.5\\%, comparable to state-of-the-art results, without the\nneed for separate training or domain-specific tools.

Quaternion Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs)\naddress this limitation by employing quaternion algebra to jointly capture\ninter-channel dependencies, enabling more compact models with fewer learnable\nparameters while better exploiting the multi-dimensional nature of audio\nsignals.

In\ncontrast, OpenStreetMap (OSM) offers a rich, user-contributed POI dataset with\ndetailed and frequently updated metadata, though it does not formally verify\nwhether a POI represents an actual business. In this data paper, we present a\nmethodology that integrates the strengths of both datasets: Foursquare as a\ncomprehensive baseline of commercial POIs and OSM as a source of enriched\nmetadata. The combined dataset totals approximately 1 TB. While this full\nversion is not publicly released, we provide filtered releases with adjustable\nthresholds that reduce storage needs and make the data practical to download\nand use across domains. We also provide step-by-step instructions to reproduce\nthe full 631 GB build. Record linkage is achieved by computing name similarity\nscores and spatial distances between Foursquare and OSM POIs. These measures\nidentify and retain high-confidence matches that correspond to real businesses\nin Foursquare, have representations in OSM, and show strong name similarity.\nFinally, we use this filtered dataset to construct a graph-based representation\nof POIs enriched with attributes from both sources, enabling advanced spatial\nanalyses and a range of downstream applications.",

To address this gap, we introduce \\textbf{Magellan}, a novel\nframework that reframes creative generation as a principled, guided exploration\nof an LLM's latent conceptual space. At its core, Magellan employs Monte Carlo\nTree Search (MCTS) governed by a hierarchical guidance system.

For local, step-by-step decisions,\na landscape-aware value function replaces flawed self-evaluation with an\nexplicit reward structure that balances intrinsic coherence, extrinsic novelty,\nand narrative progress. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Magellan\nsignificantly outperforms strong baselines, including ReAct and ToT, in\ngenerating scientific ideas with superior plausibility and innovation.

The CausalBooster utilizes the\ndiscovered causal graph to refine the attention mechanism, prioritizing\nbehaviors with causal significance. Experimental evaluations on real-world\ndatasets indicate that CausalRec outperforms several state-of-the-art methods,\nwith average improvements of 7.21% in Hit Rate (HR) and 8.65% in Normalized\nDiscounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG).

TripTide models key dimensions\nsuch as disruption severity and traveler tolerance, enabling nuanced assessment\nof LLM adaptability to events like flight cancellations, weather closures, or\noverbooked attractions. We conduct a threefold evaluation. First, we introduce\nautomatic metrics including Preservation of Intent (how well the revised plan\nmaintains feasibility and goals), Responsiveness (promptness and\nappropriateness of disruption handling), and Adaptability (semantic, spatial,\nand sequential divergence between original and revised plans). Second, we apply\nan LLM-as-a-judge approach to automatically assess revision quality. Third, we\nperform manual expert evaluation to verify whether revisions preserve semantic,\nspatial, sequential, and responsive aspects. Our experiments show that LLMs\nmaintain strong sequential consistency and semantic stability, while spatial\ndeviations are larger for shorter trips but decrease with longer ones,\nindicating that extended plans encourage better geographic coherence.
