      "abstract": "Partial differential equations (PDEs) are fundamental to modeling physical\nsystems, yet solving them remains a complex challenge. Traditional numerical\nsolvers rely on expert knowledge to implement and are computationally\nexpensive, while neural-network-based solvers require large training datasets\nand often lack interpretability. In this work, we frame PDE solving as a code\ngeneration task and introduce CodePDE, the first inference framework for\ngenerating PDE solvers using large language models (LLMs). Leveraging advanced\ninference-time algorithms and scaling strategies, CodePDE unlocks critical\ncapacities of LLM for PDE solving: reasoning, debugging, selfrefinement, and\ntest-time scaling -- all without task-specific tuning. CodePDE achieves\nsuperhuman performance across a range of representative PDE problems. We also\npresent a systematic empirical analysis of LLM generated solvers, analyzing\ntheir accuracy, efficiency, and numerical scheme choices. Our findings\nhighlight the promise and the current limitations of LLMs in PDE solving,\noffering a new perspective on solver design and opportunities for future model\ndevelopment.

Existing\napproaches struggle in complex urban environments due to redundant semantic\nprocessing, similar object distinction, and the exploration-exploitation\ndilemma. To bridge this gap and support the AVOS task, we introduce CityAVOS,\nthe first benchmark dataset for autonomous search of common urban objects. This\ndataset comprises 2,420 tasks across six object categories with varying\ndifficulty levels, enabling comprehensive evaluation of UAV agents' search\ncapabilities. To solve the AVOS tasks, we also propose PRPSearcher\n(Perception-Reasoning-Planning Searcher), a novel agentic method powered by\nmulti-modal large language models (MLLMs) that mimics human three-tier\ncognition. Specifically, PRPSearcher constructs three specialized maps: an\nobject-centric dynamic semantic map enhancing spatial perception, a 3D\ncognitive map based on semantic attraction values for target reasoning, and a\n3D uncertainty map for balanced exploration-exploitation search. Also, our\napproach incorporates a denoising mechanism to mitigate interference from\nsimilar objects and utilizes an Inspiration Promote Thought (IPT) prompting\nmechanism for adaptive action planning. Experimental results on CityAVOS\ndemonstrate that PRPSearcher surpasses existing baselines in both success rate\nand search efficiency (on average: +37.69% SR, +28.96% SPL, -30.69% MSS, and\n-46.40% NE). While promising, the performance gap compared to humans highlights\nthe need for better semantic reasoning and spatial exploration capabilities in\nAVOS tasks.

This paper represents the initial contribution of this initiative.\nWhile recent developments in mathematical LLMs have predominantly emphasized\nreasoning skills, as evidenced by benchmarks on elementary to\nundergraduate-level mathematical tasks, the creative capabilities of these\nmodels have received comparatively little attention, and evaluation datasets\nremain scarce. To address this gap, we propose an evaluation criteria for\nmathematical creativity and introduce DeepMath-Creative, a novel, high-quality\nbenchmark comprising constructive problems across algebra, geometry, analysis,\nand other domains. We conduct a systematic evaluation of mainstream LLMs'\ncreative problem-solving abilities using this dataset. Experimental results\nshow that even under lenient scoring criteria -- emphasizing core solution\ncomponents and disregarding minor inaccuracies, such as small logical gaps,\nincomplete justifications, or redundant explanations -- the best-performing\nmodel, O3 Mini, achieves merely 70% accuracy, primarily on basic\nundergraduate-level constructive tasks. Performance declines sharply on more\ncomplex problems, with models failing to provide substantive strategies for\nopen problems. These findings suggest that, although current LLMs display a\ndegree of constructive proficiency on familiar and lower-difficulty problems,\nsuch performance is likely attributable to the recombination of memorized\npatterns rather than authentic creative insight or novel synthesis.",

To operationalize\nthis insight, we introduce the Information Bottleneck Language Modeling (IBLM)\nobjective, which reframes language modeling as a constrained optimization\nproblem: minimizing representation entropy subject to optimal prediction\nperformance. Empirically, we observe an emergent memorization-compression cycle\nduring LLM pretraining, evidenced by oscillation positive/negative gradient\nalignment between cross-entropy and Matrix-Based Entropy (MBE), a measure of\nrepresentation entropy. This pattern closely mirrors the predictive-compressive\ntrade-off prescribed by IBLM and also parallels the biological alternation\nbetween awake learning and sleep consolidation. Motivated by this observation,\nwe propose Gated Phase Transition (GAPT), a training algorithm that adaptively\nswitches between memorization and compression phases. When applied to GPT-2\npretraining on FineWeb dataset, GAPT reduces MBE by 50% and improves\ncross-entropy by 4.8%. GAPT improves OOD generalizatino by 35% in a pretraining\ntask on arithmetic multiplication. In a setting designed to simulate\ncatastrophic forgetting, GAPT reduces interference by compressing and\nseparating representations, achieving a 97% improvement in separation -\nparalleling the functional role of sleep consolidation.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) hosted on cloud servers alleviate the\ncomputational and storage burdens on local devices but raise privacy concerns\ndue to sensitive data transmission and require substantial communication\nbandwidth, which is challenging in constrained environments. In contrast, small\nlanguage models (SLMs) running locally enhance privacy but suffer from limited\nperformance on complex tasks. To balance computational cost, performance, and\nprivacy protection under bandwidth constraints, we propose a privacy-aware\nwireless collaborative mixture of experts (PWC-MoE) framework. Specifically,\nPWC-MoE employs a sparse privacy-aware gating network to dynamically route\nsensitive tokens to privacy experts located on local clients, while\nnon-sensitive tokens are routed to non-privacy experts located at the remote\nbase station. To achieve computational efficiency, the gating network ensures\nthat each token is dynamically routed to and processed by only one expert. To\nenhance scalability and prevent overloading of specific experts, we introduce a\ngroup-wise load-balancing mechanism for the gating network that evenly\ndistributes sensitive tokens among privacy experts and non-sensitive tokens\namong non-privacy experts. To adapt to bandwidth constraints while preserving\nmodel performance, we propose a bandwidth-adaptive and importance-aware token\noffloading scheme. This scheme incorporates an importance predictor to evaluate\nthe importance scores of non-sensitive tokens, prioritizing the most important\ntokens for transmission to the base station based on their predicted importance\nand the available bandwidth. Experiments demonstrate that the PWC-MoE framework\neffectively preserves privacy and maintains high performance even in\nbandwidth-constrained environments, offering a practical solution for deploying\nLLMs in privacy-sensitive and bandwidth-limited scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently shown promise for solving\npartial differential equations (PDEs). Yet their original formulation is\ncomputationally and memory intensive, motivating the introduction of Chebyshev\nType-I-based KANs (Chebyshev1KANs). Although Chebyshev1KANs have outperformed\nthe vanilla KANs architecture, our rigorous theoretical analysis reveals that\nthey still suffer from rank collapse, ultimately limiting their expressive\ncapacity. To overcome these limitations, we enhance Chebyshev1KANs by\nintegrating wavelet-activated MLPs with learnable parameters and an internal\nattention mechanism. We prove that this design preserves a full-rank Jacobian\nand is capable of approximating solutions to PDEs of arbitrary order.\nFurthermore, to alleviate the loss instability and imbalance introduced by the\nChebyshev polynomial basis, we externally incorporate a Residual Gradient\nAttention (RGA) mechanism that dynamically re-weights individual loss terms\naccording to their gradient norms and residual magnitudes. By jointly\nleveraging internal and external attention, we present AC-PKAN, a novel\narchitecture that constitutes an enhancement to weakly supervised\nPhysics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and extends the expressive power of\nKANs. Experimental results from nine benchmark tasks across three domains show\nthat AC-PKAN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art models such\nas PINNsFormer, establishing it as a highly effective tool for solving complex\nreal-world engineering problems in zero-data or data-sparse regimes.

      "abstract": "Singing melody extraction (SME) is a key task in the field of music\ninformation retrieval. However, existing methods are facing several\nlimitations: firstly, prior models use transformers to capture the contextual\ndependencies, which requires quadratic computation resulting in low efficiency\nin the inference stage. Secondly, prior works typically rely on\nfrequencysupervised methods to estimate the fundamental frequency (f0), which\nignores that the musical performance is actually based on notes. Thirdly,\ntransformers typically require large amounts of labeled data to achieve optimal\nperformances, but the SME task lacks of sufficient annotated data. To address\nthese issues, in this paper, we propose a mamba-based network, called\nSpectMamba, for semi-supervised singing melody extraction using confidence\nbinary regularization. In particular, we begin by introducing vision mamba to\nachieve computational linear complexity. Then, we propose a novel note-f0\ndecoder that allows the model to better mimic the musical performance. Further,\nto alleviate the scarcity of the labeled data, we introduce a confidence binary\nregularization (CBR) module to leverage the unlabeled data by maximizing the\nprobability of the correct classes. The proposed method is evaluated on several\npublic datasets and the conducted experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Efficiently modeling and exploiting opponents is a long-standing challenge in\nadversarial domains. Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on extensive textual\ndata have recently demonstrated outstanding performance in general tasks,\nintroducing new research directions for opponent modeling. Some studies\nprimarily focus on directly using LLMs to generate decisions based on the\nelaborate prompt context that incorporates opponent descriptions, while these\napproaches are limited to scenarios where LLMs possess adequate domain\nexpertise. To address that, we introduce a two-stage Strategy-Augmented\nPlanning (SAP) framework that significantly enhances the opponent exploitation\ncapabilities of LLM-based agents by utilizing a critical component, the\nStrategy Evaluation Network (SEN). Specifically, in the offline stage, we\nconstruct an explicit strategy space and subsequently collect strategy-outcome\npair data for training the SEN network. During the online phase, SAP\ndynamically recognizes the opponent's strategies and greedily exploits them by\nsearching best response strategy on the well-trained SEN, finally translating\nstrategy to a course of actions by carefully designed prompts. Experimental\nresults show that SAP exhibits robust generalization capabilities, allowing it\nto perform effectively not only against previously encountered opponent\nstrategies but also against novel, unseen strategies. In the MicroRTS\nenvironment, SAP achieves a 85.35\\% performance improvement over baseline\nmethods and matches the competitiveness of reinforcement learning approaches\nagainst state-of-the-art (SOTA) rule-based AI.",

      "abstract": "The rise of large model-based AI agents has spurred interest in Multi-Agent\nSystems (MAS) for their capabilities in decision-making, collaboration, and\nadaptability. While the Model Context Protocol (MCP) addresses tool invocation\nand data exchange challenges via a unified protocol, it lacks support for\norganizing agent-level collaboration. To bridge this gap, we propose\nAgent-as-a-Service based on Agent Network (AaaS-AN), a service-oriented\nparadigm grounded in the Role-Goal-Process-Service (RGPS) standard. AaaS-AN\nunifies the entire agent lifecycle, including construction, integration,\ninteroperability, and networked collaboration, through two core components: (1)\na dynamic Agent Network, which models agents and agent groups as vertexes that\nself-organize within the network based on task and role dependencies; (2)\nservice-oriented agents, incorporating service discovery, registration, and\ninteroperability protocols. These are orchestrated by a Service Scheduler,\nwhich leverages an Execution Graph to enable distributed coordination, context\ntracking, and runtime task management. We validate AaaS-AN on mathematical\nreasoning and application-level code generation tasks, which outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines. Notably, we constructed a MAS based on AaaS-AN\ncontaining agent groups, Robotic Process Automation (RPA) workflows, and MCP\nservers over 100 agent services. We also release a dataset containing 10,000\nlong-horizon multi-agent workflows to facilitate future research on long-chain\ncollaboration in MAS.",

      "abstract": "Large language models achieve high task performance yet often hallucinate or\nrely on outdated knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses\nthese gaps by coupling generation with external search. We analyse how\nhyperparameters influence speed and quality in RAG systems, covering Chroma and\nFaiss vector stores, chunking policies, cross-encoder re-ranking, and\ntemperature, and we evaluate six metrics: faithfulness, answer correctness,\nanswer relevancy, context precision, context recall, and answer similarity.\nChroma processes queries 13% faster, whereas Faiss yields higher retrieval\nprecision, revealing a clear speed-accuracy trade-off. Naive fixed-length\nchunking with small windows and minimal overlap outperforms semantic\nsegmentation while remaining the quickest option. Re-ranking provides modest\ngains in retrieval quality yet increases runtime by roughly a factor of 5, so\nits usefulness depends on latency constraints. These results help practitioners\nbalance computational cost and accuracy when tuning RAG systems for\ntransparent, up-to-date responses. Finally, we re-evaluate the top\nconfigurations with a corrective RAG workflow and show that their advantages\npersist when the model can iteratively request additional evidence.

      "abstract": "Large Language Models leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for complex\ntasks, but their reasoning traces are often excessively verbose and\ninefficient, leading to significant computational costs and latency. Current\nCoT compression techniques typically rely on generic importance metrics and\nstatic compression rates, which may inadvertently remove functionally critical\ntokens or fail to adapt to varying reasoning complexity. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose Adaptive GoGI-Skip, a novel framework learning dynamic\nCoT compression via supervised fine-tuning. This approach introduces two\nsynergistic innovations: (1) Goal-Gradient Importance (GoGI), a novel metric\naccurately identifying functionally relevant tokens by measuring the gradient\ninfluence of their intermediate representations on the final answer loss, and\n(2) Adaptive Dynamic Skipping (ADS), a mechanism dynamically regulating the\ncompression rate based on runtime model uncertainty while ensuring local\ncoherence through an adaptive N-token constraint. To our knowledge, this is the\nfirst work unifying a goal-oriented, gradient-based importance metric with\ndynamic, uncertainty-aware skipping for CoT compression. Trained on compressed\nMATH data, Adaptive GoGI-Skip demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization\nacross diverse reasoning benchmarks including AIME, GPQA, and GSM8K. It\nachieves substantial efficiency gains - reducing CoT token counts by over 45%\non average and delivering 1.6-2.0 times inference speedups - while maintaining\nhigh reasoning accuracy.
