      "abstract": "We present Large Inverse Rendering Model (LIRM), a transformer architecture\nthat jointly reconstructs high-quality shape, materials, and radiance fields\nwith view-dependent effects in less than a second. Our model builds upon the\nrecent Large Reconstruction Models (LRMs) that achieve state-of-the-art\nsparse-view reconstruction quality. However, existing LRMs struggle to\nreconstruct unseen parts accurately and cannot recover glossy appearance or\ngenerate relightable 3D contents that can be consumed by standard Graphics\nengines. To address these limitations, we make three key technical\ncontributions to build a more practical multi-view 3D reconstruction framework.\nFirst, we introduce an update model that allows us to progressively add more\ninput views to improve our reconstruction. Second, we propose a hexa-plane\nneural SDF representation to better recover detailed textures, geometry and\nmaterial parameters. Third, we develop a novel neural directional-embedding\nmechanism to handle view-dependent effects. Trained on a large-scale shape and\nmaterial dataset with a tailored coarse-to-fine training scheme, our model\nachieves compelling results. It compares favorably to optimization-based\ndense-view inverse rendering methods in terms of geometry and relighting\naccuracy, while requiring only a fraction of the inference time.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have dramatically advanced machine learning\nresearch including natural language processing, computer vision, data mining,\netc., yet they still exhibit critical limitations in reasoning, factual\nconsistency, and interpretability. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning\nparadigm -- Modular Machine Learning (MML) -- as an essential approach toward\nnew-generation LLMs. MML decomposes the complex structure of LLMs into three\ninterdependent components: modular representation, modular model, and modular\nreasoning, aiming to enhance LLMs' capability of counterfactual reasoning,\nmitigating hallucinations, as well as promoting fairness, safety, and\ntransparency. Specifically, the proposed MML paradigm can: i) clarify the\ninternal working mechanism of LLMs through the disentanglement of semantic\ncomponents; ii) allow for flexible and task-adaptive model design; iii) enable\ninterpretable and logic-driven decision-making process. We present a feasible\nimplementation of MML-based LLMs via leveraging advanced techniques such as\ndisentangled representation learning, neural architecture search and\nneuro-symbolic learning. We critically identify key challenges, such as the\nintegration of continuous neural and discrete symbolic processes, joint\noptimization, and computational scalability, present promising future research\ndirections that deserve further exploration. Ultimately, the integration of the\nMML paradigm with LLMs has the potential to bridge the gap between statistical\n(deep) learning and formal (logical) reasoning, thereby paving the way for\nrobust, adaptable, and trustworthy AI systems across a wide range of real-world\napplications.",

While useful, this\nframework is insufficient for group level ontologies, where well being depends\non functional persistence, institutional roles, and historical impact rather\nthan immediate individual outcomes.

Standard deep\nlearning models often struggle with these challenges because their\narchitectures inherently smooth over fine-grained fluctuations while focusing\non general trends. This limitation arises from low-pass filtering effects, gate\nbiases favoring stability, and memory update mechanisms that prioritize\nlong-term information retention. To address these shortcomings, this study\nintroduces a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates both long-term\ntrend and short-term fluctuation information using two input features processed\nin parallel, designed to capture complementary aspects of traffic flow\ndynamics. Further, our approach leverages attention mechanisms, specifically\nBahdanau attention, to selectively focus on critical time steps within traffic\ndata, enhancing the model's ability to predict congestion and other transient\nphenomena. Experimental results demonstrate that features learned from both\nbranches are complementary, significantly improving the goodness-of-fit\nstatistics across multiple prediction horizons compared to a baseline model.\nNotably, the attention mechanism enhances short-term forecast accuracy by\ndirectly targeting immediate fluctuations, though challenges remain in fully\nintegrating long-term trends.

This research work identifies 9 primary threats\nand organizes them across five key domains: cognitive architecture\nvulnerabilities, temporal persistence threats, operational execution\nvulnerabilities, trust boundary violations, and governance circumvention. These\nthreats are not just theoretical they bring practical challenges such as\ndelayed exploitability, cross-system propagation, cross system lateral\nmovement, and subtle goal misalignments that are hard to detect with existing\nframeworks and standard approaches.

      "abstract": "Accurate modeling of aerodynamic coefficients is crucial for understanding\nand optimizing the performance of modern aircraft systems. This paper presents\nthe novel deployment of an Evolving Type-2 Quantum Fuzzy Neural Network\n(eT2QFNN) for modeling the aerodynamic coefficients of the ATTAS aircraft to\nexpress the aerodynamic characteristics. eT2QFNN can represent the nonlinear\naircraft model by creating multiple linear submodels with its rule-based\nstructure through an incremental learning strategy rather than a traditional\nbatch learning approach. Moreover, it enhances robustness to uncertainties and\ndata noise through its quantum membership functions, as well as its automatic\nrule-learning and parameter-tuning capabilities. During the estimation of the\naerodynamic coefficients via the flight data of the ATTAS, two different\nstudies are conducted in the training phase: one with a large amount of data\nand the other with a limited amount of data. The results show that the modeling\nperformance of the eT2QFNN is superior in comparison to baseline counterparts.\nFurthermore, eT2QFNN estimated the aerodynamic model with fewer rules compared\nto Type-1 fuzzy counterparts. In addition, by applying the Delta method to the\nproposed approach, the stability and control derivatives of the aircraft are\nanalyzed. The results prove the superiority of the proposed eT2QFNN in\nrepresenting aerodynamic coefficients.",

      "abstract": "We study the complexity of satisfiability problems in probabilistic and\ncausal reasoning. Given random variables $X_1, X_2,\\ldots$ over finite domains,\nthe basic terms are probabilities of propositional formulas over atomic events\n$X_i = x_i$, such as $P(X_1 = x_1)$ or $P(X_1 = x_1 \\vee X_2 = x_2)$. The basic\nterms can be combined using addition (yielding linear terms) or multiplication\n(polynomial terms). The probabilistic satisfiability problem asks whether a\njoint probability distribution satisfies a Boolean combination of\n(in)equalities over such terms. Fagin et al. (1990) showed that for basic and\nlinear terms, this problem is NP-complete, making it no harder than Boolean\nsatisfiability, while Moss\\'e et al. (2022) proved that for polynomial terms,\nit is complete for the existential theory of the reals.\n  Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH) extends the probabilistic setting with\ninterventional and counterfactual reasoning, enriching the expressiveness of\nlanguages. However, Moss\\'e et al. (2022) found that satisfiability complexity\nremains unchanged. Van der Zander et al. (2023) showed that introducing a\nmarginalization operator to languages induces a significant increase in\ncomplexity.\n  We extend this line of work by adding two new dimensions to the problem by\nconstraining the models. First, we fix the graph structure of the underlying\nstructural causal model, motivated by settings like Pearl's do-calculus, and\ngive a nearly complete landscape across different arithmetics and PCH levels.\nSecond, we study small models. While earlier work showed that satisfiable\ninstances admit polynomial-size models, this is no longer guaranteed with\ncompact marginalization. We characterize the complexities of satisfiability\nunder small-model constraints across different settings.",

In recent years, Deep Reinforcement Learning\n(DRL) has emerged as a promising tool for tackling this DTAP variant, but most\nresearch is limited to solving small-scale, synthetic problems, neglecting the\nchallenges posed by real-world use cases. To bridge this gap, this work\nproposes a DRL-based Decision Support System (DSS) for real-world scale DTAPS.\nTo this end, we introduce a DRL agent with two novel elements: a graph\nstructure for observations and actions that can effectively represent any DTAP\nand a reward function that is provably equivalent to the objective of\nminimizing the average cycle time of tasks. The combination of these two\nnovelties allows the agent to learn effective and generalizable assignment\npolicies for real-world scale DTAPs. The proposed DSS is evaluated on five DTAP\ninstances whose parameters are extracted from real-world logs through process\nmining.

Multi-view classification, especially in medical\nimaging, presents unique challenges, particularly when dealing with\nlarge-scale, high-resolution data.

Our data-oblivious\nalgorithms, suitable for online applications, achieve near-optimal distortion\nrates (within a small constant factor) across all bit-widths and dimensions.\nTurboQuant achieves this by randomly rotating input vectors, inducing a\nconcentrated Beta distribution on coordinates, and leveraging the\nnear-independence property of distinct coordinates in high dimensions to simply\napply optimal scalar quantizers per each coordinate. Recognizing that\nMSE-optimal quantizers introduce bias in inner product estimation, we propose a\ntwo-stage approach: applying an MSE quantizer followed by a 1-bit Quantized JL\n(QJL) transform on the residual, resulting in an unbiased inner product\nquantizer. We also provide a formal proof of the information-theoretic lower\nbounds on best achievable distortion rate by any vector quantizer,\ndemonstrating that TurboQuant closely matches these bounds, differing only by a\nsmall constant ($\\approx 2.7$) factor.

      "abstract": "This dissertation establishes the contexture theory to mathematically\ncharacterize the mechanism of representation learning, or pretraining. Despite\nthe remarkable empirical success of foundation models, it is not very clear\nwhat representations they learn, and why these representations are useful for\nvarious downstream tasks. A scientific understanding of representation learning\nis critical, especially at this point when scaling up the model size is\nproducing diminishing returns, and designing new pretraining methods is\nimperative for further progress.\n  Prior work treated different representation learning methods quite\ndifferently, whereas the contexture theory provides a unified framework for\nanalyzing these methods. The central argument is that a representation is\nlearned from the association between the input X and a context variable A. We\nprove that if an encoder captures the maximum information of this association,\nin which case we say that the encoder learns the contexture, then it will be\noptimal on the class of tasks that are compatible with the context. We also\nshow that a context is the most useful when the association between X and A is\nneither too strong nor too weak. The important implication of the contexture\ntheory is that increasing the model size alone will achieve diminishing\nreturns, and further advancements require better contexts.\n  We demonstrate that many pretraining objectives can learn the contexture,\nincluding supervised learning, self-supervised learning, generative models,\netc. Then, we introduce two general objectives -- SVME and KISE, for learning\nthe contexture. We also show how to mix multiple contexts together, an\neffortless way to create better contexts from existing ones. Then, we prove\nstatistical learning bounds for representation learning. Finally, we discuss\nthe effect of the data distribution shift from pretraining to the downstream\ntask.",

Modeling and calibration errors are therefore unavoidable, making\nthe transfer of control systems from simulation to real-world systems a\ncritical challenge. Traditional robust controls have limitations in handling\ncertain types of nonlinearities and uncertainties, requiring a more practical\napproach capable of comprehensively compensating for these various constraints.\nThis study proposes a new robust control approach using the framework of deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL). The key strategy lies in the synergy among domain\nrandomization-based DRL, long short-term memory (LSTM)-based actor and critic\nnetworks, and model-based control (MBC). The problem setup is modeled via the\nlatent Markov decision process (LMDP), a set of vanilla MDPs, for a controlled\nsystem subject to uncertainties and nonlinearities. In LMDP, the dynamics of an\nenvironment simulator is randomized during training to improve the robustness\nof the control system to real testing environments. The randomization increases\ntraining difficulties as well as conservativeness of the resultant control\nsystem; therefore, progress is assisted by concurrent use of a model-based\ncontroller based on a nominal system model. Compared to traditional DRL-based\ncontrols, the proposed controller design is smarter in that we can achieve a\nhigh level of generalization ability with a more compact neural network\narchitecture and a smaller amount of training data. The proposed approach is\nverified via practical application to active damping for a complex powertrain\nsystem with nonlinearities and parametric variations.

Combining language\nmodels with knowledge graphs (GraphRAG) offers promising avenues for overcoming\nthese deficits. However, a major challenge lies in creating such a knowledge\ngraph in the first place. Here, we propose a novel approach that combines LLMs\nwith a tripartite knowledge graph representation, which is constructed by\nconnecting complex, domain-specific objects via a curated ontology of\ncorresponding, domain-specific concepts to relevant sections within chunks of\ntext through a concept-anchored pre-analysis of source documents starting from\nan initial lexical graph.

Gradual drifts in odometry\nand pose estimation inaccuracies hinder modern 2D LiDAR-odometry algorithms in\nlarge complex environments. Dynamic robotic motion coupled with inherent\nestimation based SLAM processes introduce noise and errors, degrading map\nquality. Occupancy Grid Mapping (OGM) produces results that are often noisy and\nunclear. This is due to the fact that evidence based mapping represents maps\naccording to uncertain observations.

      "abstract": "SLAM is a fundamental component of modern autonomous systems, providing\nrobots and their operators with a deeper understanding of their environment.\nSLAM systems often encounter challenges due to the dynamic nature of robotic\nmotion, leading to inaccuracies in mapping quality, particularly in 2D\nrepresentations such as Occupancy Grid Maps. These errors can significantly\ndegrade map quality, hindering the effectiveness of specific downstream tasks\nsuch as floor plan creation. To address this challenge, we introduce our novel\n'GAN-SLAM', a new SLAM approach that leverages Generative Adversarial Networks\nto clean and complete occupancy grids during the SLAM process, reducing the\nimpact of noise and inaccuracies introduced on the output map. We adapt and\nintegrate accurate pose estimation techniques typically used for 3D SLAM into a\n2D form. This enables the quality improvement 3D LiDAR-odometry has seen in\nrecent years to be effective for 2D representations. Our results demonstrate\nsubstantial improvements in map fidelity and quality, with minimal noise and\nerrors, affirming the effectiveness of GAN-SLAM for real-world mapping\napplications within large-scale complex environments. We validate our approach\non real-world data operating in real-time, and on famous examples of 2D maps.\nThe improved quality of the output map enables new downstream tasks, such as\nfloor plan drafting, further enhancing the capabilities of autonomous systems.\nOur novel approach to SLAM offers a significant step forward in the field,\nimproving the usability for SLAM in mapping-based tasks, and offers insight\ninto the usage of GANs for OGM error correction.",

      "abstract": "- The field of natural language processing (NLP) has dramatically expanded\nwithin the last decade. Many human-being applications are conducted daily via\nNLP tasks, starting from machine translation, speech recognition, text\ngeneration and recommendations, Part-of-Speech tagging (POS), and Named-Entity\nRecognition (NER). However, low-resourced languages, such as the\nCentral-Kurdish language (CKL), mainly remain unexamined due to shortage of\nnecessary resources to support their development. The POS tagging task is the\nbase of other NLP tasks; for example, the POS tag set has been used to\nstandardized languages to provide the relationship between words among the\nsentences, followed by machine translation and text recommendation.\nSpecifically, for the CKL, most of the utilized or provided POS tagsets are\nneither standardized nor comprehensive. To this end, this study presented an\naccurate and comprehensive POS tagset for the CKL to provide better performance\nof the Kurdish NLP tasks. The article also collected most of the POS tags from\ndifferent studies as well as from Kurdish linguistic experts to standardized\npart-of-speech tags. The proposed POS tagset is designed to annotate a large\nCKL corpus and support Kurdish NLP tasks. The initial investigations of this\nstudy via comparison with the Universal Dependencies framework for standard\nlanguages, show that the proposed POS tagset can streamline or correct\nsentences more accurately for Kurdish NLP tasks.",

In this paper, we illustrate and\nanalyze the fitness landscape of LLM-assisted Algorithm Search (LAS) using a\ngraph-based approach, where nodes represent algorithms and edges denote\ntransitions between them. We conduct extensive evaluations across six algorithm\ndesign tasks and six commonly used LLMs. Our findings reveal that LAS\nlandscapes are highly multimodal and rugged, particularly in combinatorial\noptimization tasks, with distinct structural variations across tasks and LLMs.\nFor instance, heuristic design tasks exhibit dense clusters of high-performing\nalgorithms, while symbolic regression tasks show sparse, scattered\ndistributions. Additionally, we demonstrate how population size influences\nexploration-exploitation trade-offs and the evolving trajectory of elite\nalgorithms. These insights not only advance our understanding of LAS landscapes\nbut also provide practical guidance for designing more effective LAS methods.",

The method provides intuitive physical\ninterpretations: its gradient mirrors the mean squared error between the\ncentral distance of implicit rewards and that of actual rewards. GVPO offers\ntwo key advantages: (1) it guarantees a unique optimal solution, exactly the\nKL-constrained reward maximization objective, (2) it supports flexible sampling\ndistributions that avoids on-policy and importance sampling limitations.

      "abstract": "Deep learning methods have shown promising performances in remote sensing\nimage change detection (CD). However, existing methods usually train a\ndataset-specific deep network for each dataset. Due to the significant\ndifferences in the data distribution and labeling between various datasets, the\ntrained dataset-specific deep network has poor generalization performances on\nother datasets. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a change adapter\nnetwork (CANet) for a more universal and generalized CD. CANet contains\ndataset-shared and dataset-specific learning modules. The former explores the\ndiscriminative features of images, and the latter designs a lightweight adapter\nmodel, to deal with the characteristics of different datasets in data\ndistribution and labeling. The lightweight adapter can quickly generalize the\ndeep network for new CD tasks with a small computation cost. Specifically, this\npaper proposes an interesting change region mask (ICM) in the adapter, which\ncan adaptively focus on interested change objects and decrease the influence of\nlabeling differences in various datasets. Moreover, CANet adopts a unique batch\nnormalization layer for each dataset to deal with data distribution\ndifferences. Compared with existing deep learning methods, CANet can achieve\nsatisfactory CD performances on various datasets simultaneously. Experimental\nresults on several public datasets have verified the effectiveness and\nadvantages of the proposed CANet on CD. CANet has a stronger generalization\nability, smaller training costs (merely updating 4.1%-7.7% parameters), and\nbetter performances under limited training datasets than other deep learning\nmethods, which also can be flexibly inserted with existing deep models.",
