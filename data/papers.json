      "abstract": "Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) offer flexible, non-autoregressive generation, but this freedom introduces a challenge: final output quality is highly sensitive to the decoding order. We are the first to formalize this issue, attributing the variability in output quality to the cumulative predictive uncertainty along a generative path. To quantify this uncertainty, we introduce Denoising Entropy, a computable metric that serves as an internal signal for evaluating generative process. Leveraging this metric, we propose two algorithms designed to optimize the decoding path: a post-hoc selection method and a real-time guidance strategy. Experiments demonstrate that our entropy-guided methods significantly improve generation quality, consistently boosting accuracy on challenging reasoning, planning, and code benchmarks. Our work establishes Denoising Entropy as a principled tool for understanding and controlling generation, effectively turning the uncertainty in MDMs from a liability into a key advantage for discovering high-quality solutions.",

      "abstract": "Separating signal from noise is central to experimental science. Applying well-established statistical method effectively to LLM evals requires consideration of their unique noise characteristics. We clearly define and measure three types of noise: prediction noise from generating different answers on a given question, data noise from sampling questions, and their combined total noise following the law of total variance. To emphasize relative comparisons and gain statistical power, we propose the all-pairs paired method, which applies the paired analysis to all pairs of LLMs and measures all the noise components based on millions of question-level predictions across many evals and settings. These measurements revealed clear patterns. First, each eval exhibits a characteristic and highly predictable total noise level across all model pairs. Second, paired prediction noise typically exceeds paired data noise, which means reducing prediction noise by averaging can significantly increase statistical power. These findings enable practitioners to assess significance without custom testing and to detect much smaller effects in controlled experiments.",

      "abstract": "Model merging has emerged as a lightweight alternative to joint multi-task learning (MTL), yet the generalization properties of merged models remain largely unexplored. Establishing such theoretical guarantees is non-trivial, as the merging process typically forbids access to the original training data and involves combining fine-tuned models trained on fundamentally heterogeneous data distributions. Without a principled understanding of these dynamics, current methods often rely on heuristics to approximate the optimal combination of parameters. This dependence is most critical in coefficient scaling, the weighting factors that modulate the magnitude of each fine-tuned model's contribution to the shared parameter. However, without a principled objective to guide their selection, these methods lead to brittle performance and are highly sensitive to scaling initialization. We address this gap by (i) establishing a novel flatness-aware PAC-Bayes generalization bound specifically for the model merging setting. This analysis introduces a \"cross-task heterogeneity\" term that formally captures the mismatch between diverse fine-tuned model priors and the target multi-task distributions. Guided by this theoretical insight, (ii) we frame model merging as multi-teacher knowledge distillation on scarce, unlabeled data. We formally demonstrate that minimizing the student-teacher Kullback-Leibler divergence directly tightens the upper bound on the merged model's excess risk. Guided by the flatness-aware bound derived, (iii) we operationalize this objective via SAMerging, a method that employs Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) to find flat minima. Empirically, SAMerging establishes a new state of the art across vision and NLP benchmarks, achieving remarkable performance. The code is available at https://github.com/arshandalili/SAMerging.",

      "abstract": "The user of Engineering Manuals (EM) finds it difficult to read EM s because they are long, have a dense format which includes written documents, step by step procedures, and standard parameter lists for engineering equipment. Off the shelf transformers, especially compact ones, treat this material as a flat stream of tokens. This approach leads to confident but incorrect numeric answers and forces the models to memorize separate facts inefficiently. SMART (Structured Memory and Reasoning Transformer) offers a different and practical solution to the above problem. SMART structures its processing by using a hierarchical approach, and is based upon three main job categories (1) A syntax-aware Fact Extractor (Grammarian) Tree LSTM which extracts facts as subject relation object relations from EM sentences (2) A compact indexed memory MANN (Memory Augmented Neural Network) that indexes these Rational Subject Relation Objects as 384 dimensional vectors that are associated with the source of the information, and (3) A 6 layer Transformer that learns to fuse the previously retrieved facts into its generated response. The entire SMART model utilizes 45.51M parameters, which is 64% less than GPT-2 (124M) and 69% less than BERT (133M), and it achieves a 21.3% higher accuracy than GPT-2, indicating that SMART fits the data better with the least amount of processing requirements. SMART employs dual modes of inference an indexed fast path for known documents (sub-second answer times) and an indexed dynamic path assisted by RAGs for new uploads (FAISS Top 20 results with memory severed at 64 slots). In real world deployment, this framework leads to more well supported results with reduced hallucinations than comparable small transformer models.",

Nevertheless, most existing studies focus on higher education and conventional instructional contexts, leaving open questions about how key learning factors are related in AI-mediated learning environments and how these relationships may vary across different age groups. Addressing these gaps, our work investigates whether four critical learning factors, experience, clarity, comfort, and motivation, maintain coherent interrelationships in AI-augmented educational settings, and how the structure of these relationships differs between middle and high school students. The study was conducted in authentic classroom contexts where students interacted with AI tools as part of programming learning activities to collect data on the four learning factors and students' perceptions. Using a multimethod quantitative analysis, which combined correlation analysis and text mining, we revealed markedly different dimensional structures between the two age groups. Middle school students exhibit strong positive correlations across all dimensions, indicating holistic evaluation patterns whereby positive perceptions in one dimension generalise to others. In contrast, high school students show weak or near-zero correlations between key dimensions, suggesting a more differentiated evaluation process in which dimensions are assessed independently. These findings reveal that perception dimensions actively mediate AI-augmented learning and that the developmental stage moderates their interdependencies. This work establishes a foundation for the development of AI integration strategies that respond to learners' developmental levels and account for age-specific dimensional structures in student-AI interactions.",

      "abstract": "Methods that use Large Language Models (LLM) as planners for embodied instruction following tasks have become widespread. To successfully complete tasks, the LLM must be grounded in the environment in which the robot operates. One solution is to use a scene graph that contains all the necessary information. Modern methods rely on prebuilt scene graphs and assume that all task-relevant information is available at the start of planning. However, these approaches do not account for changes in the environment that may occur between the graph construction and the task execution. We propose LookPlanGraph - a method that leverages a scene graph composed of static assets and object priors. During plan execution, LookPlanGraph continuously updates the graph with relevant objects, either by verifying existing priors or discovering new entities. This is achieved by processing the agents egocentric camera view using a Vision Language Model. We conducted experiments with changed object positions VirtualHome and OmniGibson simulated environments, demonstrating that LookPlanGraph outperforms methods based on predefined static scene graphs. To demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach, we also conducted experiments in a real-world setting. Additionally, we introduce the GraSIF (Graph Scenes for Instruction Following) dataset with automated validation framework, comprising 514 tasks drawn from SayPlan Office, BEHAVIOR-1K, and VirtualHome RobotHow.

In this paper, we focus on optimizing a representative class of attacks that search for the optimal ray direction yielding the minimum $\\ell_2$-norm perturbation required to move a benign image into the adversarial region. Inspired by Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG), we propose a momentum-based algorithm, ARS-OPT, which proactively estimates the gradient with respect to a future ray direction inferred from accumulated momentum. We provide a theoretical analysis of its convergence behavior, showing that ARS-OPT enables more accurate directional updates and achieves faster, more stable optimization. To further accelerate convergence, we incorporate surrogate-model priors into ARS-OPT's gradient estimation, resulting in PARS-OPT with enhanced performance. The superiority of our approach is supported by theoretical guarantees under standard assumptions. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that our method surpasses 13 state-of-the-art approaches in query efficiency.",

However, this accessibility extends to malicious actors who may exploit these powerful tools to generate harmful software. Existing jailbreaking research primarily focuses on general attack scenarios against LLMs, with limited exploration of malicious code generation as a jailbreak target. To address this gap, we propose SPELL, a comprehensive testing framework specifically designed to evaluate the weakness of security alignment in malicious code generation. Our framework employs a time-division selection strategy that systematically constructs jailbreaking prompts by intelligently combining sentences from a prior knowledge dataset, balancing exploration of novel attack patterns with exploitation of successful techniques. Extensive evaluation across three advanced code models (GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5, and Qwen2.5-Coder) demonstrates SPELL's effectiveness, achieving attack success rates of 83.75%, 19.38%, and 68.12% respectively across eight malicious code categories. The generated prompts successfully produce malicious code in real-world AI development tools such as Cursor, with outputs confirmed as malicious by state-of-the-art detection systems at rates exceeding 73%. These findings reveal significant security gaps in current LLM implementations and provide valuable insights for improving AI safety alignment in code generation applications.",

Leveraging the recently developed MatterSim interatomic potential, which achieves DFT-level accuracy in phonon predictions across more than 10,000 materials, PhononBench enables efficient large-scale phonon calculations and dynamical-stability analysis for 108,843 crystal structures generated by six leading crystal generation models. PhononBench reveals a widespread limitation of current generative models in ensuring dynamical stability: the average dynamical-stability rate across all generated structures is only 25.83%, with the top-performing model, MatterGen, reaching just 41.0%. Further case studies show that in property-targeted generation-illustrated here by band-gap conditioning with MatterGen--the dynamical-stability rate remains as low as 23.5% even at the optimal band-gap condition of 0.5 eV. In space-group-controlled generation, higher-symmetry crystals exhibit better stability (e.g., cubic systems achieve rates up to 49.2%), yet the average stability across all controlled generations is still only 34.4%. An important additional outcome of this study is the identification of 28,119 crystal structures that are phonon-stable across the entire Brillouin zone, providing a substantial pool of reliable candidates for future materials exploration. By establishing the first large-scale dynamical-stability benchmark, this work systematically highlights the current limitations of crystal generation models and offers essential evaluation criteria and guidance for their future development toward the design and discovery of physically viable materials.

Runtime safety guardrails, which intercept hazardous actions during task execution, offer a promising solution due to their flexibility. However, existing defenses often rely on static rule filters or prompt-level control, which struggle to address implicit risks arising in dynamic, temporally dependent, and context-rich environments. To address this, we propose RoboSafe, a hybrid reasoning runtime safeguard for embodied agents through executable predicate-based safety logic. RoboSafe integrates two complementary reasoning processes on a Hybrid Long-Short Safety Memory. We first propose a Backward Reflective Reasoning module that continuously revisits recent trajectories in short-term memory to infer temporal safety predicates and proactively triggers replanning when violations are detected. We then propose a Forward Predictive Reasoning module that anticipates upcoming risks by generating context-aware safety predicates from the long-term safety memory and the agent's multimodal observations. Together, these components form an adaptive, verifiable safety logic that is both interpretable and executable as code. Extensive experiments across multiple agents demonstrate that RoboSafe substantially reduces hazardous actions (-36.8% risk occurrence) compared with leading baselines, while maintaining near-original task performance. Real-world evaluations on physical robotic arms further confirm its practicality. Code will be released upon acceptance.",

We cast such low-resource speech representation learning as a meta-learning problem and construct a multi-task adaptive pre-training (MAdaPT) protocol which formulates the adaptation process as a bi-level optimization framework. To enable scalable meta-training under this framework, we propose a novel heuristic solution, first-order bi-level optimization (FOBLO), avoiding heavy computation costs. Finally, we stabilize meta-training by using a robust initialization through interleaved supervision which alternates self-supervised and supervised objectives. Empirically, SpidR-Adapt achieves rapid gains in phonemic discriminability (ABX) and spoken language modeling (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC), improving over in-domain language models after training on less than 1h of target-language audio, over $100\\times$ more data-efficient than standard training.

However, existing ZSON methods often struggle in realistic and cluttered environments, particularly when the scene contains heavy occlusions, unknown risks, or dynamically moving target objects. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{Schrödinger's Navigator}, a navigation framework inspired by Schrödinger's thought experiment on uncertainty. The framework treats unobserved space as a set of plausible future worlds and reasons over them before acting. Conditioned on egocentric visual inputs and three candidate trajectories, a trajectory-conditioned 3D world model imagines future observations along each path. This enables the agent to see beyond occlusions and anticipate risks in unseen regions without requiring extra detours or dense global mapping. The imagined 3D observations are fused into the navigation map and used to update a value map. These updates guide the policy toward trajectories that avoid occlusions, reduce exposure to uncertain space, and better track moving targets. Experiments on a Go2 quadruped robot across three challenging scenarios, including severe static occlusions, unknown risks, and dynamically moving targets, show that Schrödinger's Navigator consistently outperforms strong ZSON baselines in self-localization, object localization, and overall Success Rate in occlusion-heavy environments. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of trajectory-conditioned 3D imagination in enabling robust zero-shot object navigation.",

To tackle these challenges, we propose TGC-Net, a CLIP-based framework focusing on parameter-efficient, task-specific adaptations. Specifically, it incorporates a Semantic-Structural Synergy Encoder (SSE) that augments CLIP's ViT with a CNN branch for multi-scale structural refinement, a Domain-Augmented Text Encoder (DATE) that injects large-language-model-derived medical knowledge, and a Vision-Language Calibration Module (VLCM) that refines cross-modal correspondence in a unified feature space.

However, relying on manually-crafted benchmarks is insufficient in the long term, because benchmarks (i) naturally end up contaminating training data, (ii) must extend to new tasks to provide a more complete picture, and (iii) must increase in difficulty to challenge more capable LLMs. In this work, we address these challenges and present AutoBaxBuilder, a framework that generates tasks and tests for code security benchmarking from scratch. We introduce a robust pipeline with fine-grained plausibility checks, leveraging the code understanding capabilities of LLMs to construct functionality tests and end-to-end security-probing exploits. To confirm the quality of the generated benchmark, we conduct both a qualitative analysis and perform quantitative experiments, comparing it against tasks constructed by human experts. We use AutoBaxBuilder to construct entirely new tasks and release them to the public as AutoBaxBench, together with a thorough evaluation of the security capabilities of LLMs on these tasks.

We present, to our knowledge, the first evaluation of an LLM-based medication safety review system on real NHS primary care data, with detailed characterisation of key failure behaviours across varying levels of clinical complexity. In a retrospective study using a population-scale EHR spanning 2,125,549 adults in NHS Cheshire and Merseyside, we strategically sampled patients to capture a broad range of clinical complexity and medication safety risk, yielding 277 patients after data-quality exclusions. An expert clinician reviewed these patients and graded system-identified issues and proposed interventions. Our primary LLM system showed strong performance in recognising when a clinical issue is present (sensitivity 100\\% [95\\% CI 98.2--100], specificity 83.1\\% [95\\% CI 72.7--90.1]), yet correctly identified all issues and interventions in only 46.9\\% [95\\% CI 41.1--52.8] of patients. Failure analysis reveals that, in this setting, the dominant failure mechanism is contextual reasoning rather than missing medication knowledge, with five primary patterns: overconfidence in uncertainty, applying standard guidelines without adjusting for patient context, misunderstanding how healthcare is delivered in practice, factual errors, and process blindness. These patterns persisted across patient complexity and demographic strata, and across a range of state-of-the-art models and configurations. We provide 45 detailed vignettes that comprehensively cover all identified failure cases. This work highlights shortcomings that must be addressed before LLM-based clinical AI can be safely deployed. It also begs larger-scale, prospective evaluations and deeper study of LLM behaviours in clinical contexts.",

Our analysis demonstrates the circumvention of reliable safety mechanisms through emotional framing, progressive revelation, and academic justification techniques. Notably, reasoning-enabled configurations amplified rather than mitigated the effectiveness of exploitation, increasing factual precision while failing to interrogate the underlying intent. The exception was Claude Opus 4.1, which prioritized intent detection over information provision in some use cases.

To address these issues, we suggest a different approach: utilizing semi-supervised learning techniques, which leverage both labeled and unlabeled data, to improve the performance on the safety task. We analyze the improvements that these techniques can offer for both prompts given to Large Language Models and the responses to those requests.

This structure-semantics heterogeneity implies that no graph learning model with a fixed inductive bias can generalize optimally across diverse graph domains. However, most existing methods address this challenge from the model side by incrementally injecting new inductive biases, which remains fundamentally limited given the open-ended diversity of real-world graphs. In this work, we take a data-centric perspective and treat node semantics as a task-adaptive variable. We propose a Data-Adaptive Semantic Refinement framework DAS for graph representation learning, which couples a fixed graph neural network (GNN) and a large language model (LLM) in a closed feedback loop. The GNN provides implicit supervisory signals to guide the semantic refinement of LLM, and the refined semantics are fed back to update the same graph learner. We evaluate our approach on both text-rich and text-free graphs. Results show consistent improvements on structure-dominated graphs while remaining competitive on semantics-rich graphs, demonstrating the effectiveness of data-centric semantic adaptation under structure-semantics heterogeneity.",

With the emergence of high-fidelity and efficient representations such as 3D Gaussians, recent works have pushed toward ultra-detailed head avatars. Existing approaches typically fall into two categories: rule-based analytic rigging or neural network-based deformation fields. While effective in constrained settings, both approaches often fail to generalize to unseen expressions and poses, particularly in extreme reenactment scenarios. Other methods constrain Gaussians to the global texel space of 3DMMs to reduce rendering complexity. However, these texel-based avatars tend to underutilize the underlying mesh structure. They apply minimal analytic deformation and rely heavily on neural regressors and heuristic regularization in UV space, which weakens geometric consistency and limits extrapolation to complex, out-of-distribution deformations. To address these limitations, we introduce TexAvatars, a hybrid avatar representation that combines the explicit geometric grounding of analytic rigging with the spatial continuity of texel space. Our approach predicts local geometric attributes in UV space via CNNs, but drives 3D deformation through mesh-aware Jacobians, enabling smooth and semantically meaningful transitions across triangle boundaries. This hybrid design separates semantic modeling from geometric control, resulting in improved generalization, interpretability, and stability. Furthermore, TexAvatars captures fine-grained expression effects, including muscle-induced wrinkles, glabellar lines, and realistic mouth cavity geometry, with high fidelity. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under extreme pose and expression variations, demonstrating strong generalization in challenging head reenactment settings.",

We prove an if-and-only-if characterization: when (i) methods observe only the aggregate outcome (aggregate-only observation) and (ii) evaluation depends only on the submitted artifact and not on the algorithm's identity or provenance (algorithm-blind evaluation), swapping humans for personas is just panel change from the method's point of view, indistinguishable from changing the evaluation population (e.g., New York to Jakarta). Furthermore, we move from validity to usefulness: we define an information-theoretic discriminability of the induced aggregate channel and show that making persona benchmarking as decision-relevant as a field experiment is fundamentally a sample-size question, yielding explicit bounds on the number of independent persona evaluations required to reliably distinguish meaningfully different methods at a chosen resolution.",

A central obstacle is the lack of a rigorous understanding of feature learning at large depth. While muP characterizes feature-learning dynamics in the infinite-width limit and enables hyperparameter transfer across width, its depth extension (depth-muP) breaks down for residual blocks with more than one internal layer. We derive Neural Feature Dynamics (NFD) for ResNets with single-layer residual blocks, characterizing feature learning via a coupled forward-backward stochastic system in the joint infinite-width and infinite-depth limit. In this regime, NFD identifies when scaling-law trends persist and explains diminishing returns. It also reveals a vanishing mechanism induced by the 1/sqrt(depth) residual scaling under which the gradient-independence assumption (GIA), known to fail during training at finite depth, becomes provably valid again at infinite depth, yielding an analytically tractable regime for end-to-end feature learning. Motivated by this insight, we study two-layer residual blocks and show that the same mechanism causes feature-learning collapse in the first internal layer at large depth, providing a structural explanation for the empirical failure of depth-muP. Based on this diagnosis, we propose a depth-aware learning-rate correction that counteracts the collapse and empirically restores depth-wise hyperparameter transfer, yielding stronger performance in deeper ResNets.",

Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for translating technical explanations into accessible narratives, yet the integration of agentic AI, where LLMs operate as autonomous agents through iterative refinement, with XAI remains unexplored. This study proposes an agentic XAI framework combining SHAP-based explainability with multimodal LLM-driven iterative refinement to generate progressively enhanced explanations. As a use case, we tested this framework as an agricultural recommendation system using rice yield data from 26 fields in Japan. The Agentic XAI initially provided a SHAP result and explored how to improve the explanation through additional analysis iteratively across 11 refinement rounds (Rounds 0-10). Explanations were evaluated by human experts (crop scientists) (n=12) and LLMs (n=14) against seven metrics: Specificity, Clarity, Conciseness, Practicality, Contextual Relevance, Cost Consideration, and Crop Science Credibility. Both evaluator groups confirmed that the framework successfully enhanced recommendation quality with an average score increase of 30-33% from Round 0, peaking at Rounds 3-4. However, excessive refinement showed a substantial drop in recommendation quality, indicating a bias-variance trade-off where early rounds lacked explanation depth (bias) while excessive iteration introduced verbosity and ungrounded abstraction (variance), as revealed by metric-specific analysis. These findings suggest that strategic early stopping (regularization) is needed for optimizing practical utility, challenging assumptions about monotonic improvement and providing evidence-based design principles for agentic XAI systems.",

      "abstract": "In multi-agent tasks, the central challenge lies in the dynamic adaptation of strategies. However, directly conditioning on opponents' strategies is intractable in the prevalent deep reinforcement learning paradigm due to a fundamental ``representational bottleneck'': neural policies are opaque, high-dimensional parameter vectors that are incomprehensible to other agents. In this work, we propose a paradigm shift that bridges this gap by representing policies as human-interpretable source code and utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) as approximate interpreters. This programmatic representation allows us to operationalize the game-theoretic concept of \\textit{Program Equilibrium}. We reformulate the learning problem by utilizing LLMs to perform optimization directly in the space of programmatic policies. The LLM functions as a point-wise best-response operator that iteratively synthesizes and refines the ego agent's policy code to respond to the opponent's strategy. We formalize this process as \\textit{Programmatic Iterated Best Response (PIBR)}, an algorithm where the policy code is optimized by textual gradients, using structured feedback derived from game utility and runtime unit tests. We demonstrate that this approach effectively solves several standard coordination matrix games and a cooperative Level-Based Foraging environment.",

However, in conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), the model could allocate disproportionately more attention to CoT sequences with excessive length. This reduces focus on the much shorter but essential Key portion-the final answer, whose correctness directly determines task success and evaluation quality. To address this limitation, we propose SFTKey, a two-stage training scheme. In the first stage, conventional SFT is applied to ensure proper output format, while in the second stage, only the Key portion is fine-tuned to improve accuracy. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families demonstrate that SFTKey achieves an average accuracy improvement exceeding 5\\% over conventional SFT, while preserving the ability to generate correct formats. Overall, this study advances LLM fine-tuning by explicitly balancing CoT learning with additional optimization on answer-relevant tokens.",

Primarily using static scoring, current evaluation methods are fundamentally limited. They struggle to determine the proper mix ratio across diverse benchmarks, and critically, they fail to capture a model's dynamic competitive fitness or its vulnerability when confronted with sequential, high-stakes tasks. To address this, we introduce the novel Competitive Swiss-System Dynamics (CSD) framework. CSD simulates a multi-round, sequential contest where models are dynamically paired across a curated sequence of benchmarks based on their accumulated win-loss record. And Monte Carlo Simulation ($N=100,000$ iterations) is used to approximate the statistically robust Expected Win Score ($E[S_m]$), which eliminates the noise of random pairing and early-round luck. Furthermore, we implement a Failure Sensitivity Analysis by parameterizing the per-round elimination quantity ($T_k$), which allows us to profile models based on their risk appetite--distinguishing between robust generalists and aggressive specialists. We demonstrate that CSD provides a more nuanced and context-aware ranking than traditional aggregate scoring and static pairwise models, representing a vital step towards risk-informed, next-generation LLM evaluation.",

      "abstract": "Distilling the reasoning capabilities from a large language model (LLM) to a smaller student model often involves training on substantial amounts of reasoning data. However, distillation over lengthy sequences with prompt (P), chain-of-thought (CoT), and answer (A) segments makes the process computationally expensive. In this work, we investigate how the allocation of supervision across different segments (P, CoT, A) affects student performance. Our analysis shows that selective knowledge distillation over only the CoT tokens can be effective when the prompt and answer information is encompassed by it. Building on this insight, we establish a truncation protocol to quantify computation-quality tradeoffs as a function of sequence length. We observe that training on only the first $50\\%$ of tokens of every training sequence can retain, on average, $\\approx94\\%$ of full-sequence performance on math benchmarks while reducing training time, memory usage, and FLOPs by about $50\\%$ each. These findings suggest that reasoning distillation benefits from prioritizing early reasoning tokens and provides a simple lever for computation-quality tradeoffs.

To solve this challenge, we propose TrafficSimAgent, an LLM-based agent framework that serves as an expert in experiment design and decision optimization for general-purpose traffic simulation tasks. The framework facilitates execution through cross-level collaboration among expert agents: high-level expert agents comprehend natural language instructions with high flexibility, plan the overall experiment workflow, and invoke corresponding MCP-compatible tools on demand; meanwhile, low-level expert agents select optimal action plans for fundamental elements based on real-time traffic conditions. Extensive experiments across multiple scenarios show that TrafficSimAgent effectively executes simulations under various conditions and consistently produces reasonable outcomes even when user instructions are ambiguous. Besides, the carefully designed expert-level autonomous decision-driven optimization in TrafficSimAgent yields superior performance when compared with other systems and SOTA LLM based methods.",

The framework is implemented in a modular multi-agent architecture, which has specific agents (budgeting, nutrition, price monitoring, and health personalization). These agents share the knowledge base and use the substitution graph to ensure that the nutritional quality is maintained at a minimum cost. Simulations with a representative Saudi household case study show a steady 12-18\\% reduction in costs relative to a static weekly menu, nutrient adequacy of over 95\\% and high performance with price changes of 20-30%.

The paper suggests a single architecture model comprising of LangChain-based multi-agent system with a permissioned blockchain to guarantee constant monitoring, policy enforcement, and immutable auditability of agentic action. The framework relates the perception conceptualization-action cycle to a blockchain layer of governance that verifies the inputs, evaluates recommended actions, and documents the outcomes of the execution.

Separating semantics and acoustics stabilizes decoding and yields more faithful, content-aligned target speech. Both stages use continuous SSL or codec embeddings, offering richer context than discretized-prompt methods. To reduce exposure bias, we employ a Frozen-LM Conditioning training strategy that conditions the LMs on predicted tokens from earlier checkpoints to reduce the gap between teacher-forcing training and autoregressive inference.

As a result, recent deep BRL methods have started to incorporate model learning, though the use of neural networks directly on the joint data and task parameters requires optimising the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). ELBOs are difficult to optimise and may result in indistinctive task parameters, hence compromised BRL policies. To this end, we introduce a novel deep BRL method, Generalised Linear Models in Deep Bayesian RL with Learnable Basis Functions (GLiBRL), that enables efficient and accurate learning of transition and reward models, with fully tractable marginal likelihood and Bayesian inference on task parameters and model noises. On challenging MetaWorld ML10/45 benchmarks, GLiBRL improves the success rate of one of the state-of-the-art deep BRL methods, VariBAD, by up to 2.7x.

The state-of-the-art method, Ring-Attention, suffers from scalability limitations due to its excessive communication traffic. This paper proposes a new distributed attention algorithm, Mesh-Attention, by rethinking the design space of distributed attention with a new matrix-based model. Our method assigns a two-dimensional tile -- rather than one-dimensional row or column -- of computation blocks to each GPU to achieve higher efficiency through lower communication-computation (CommCom) ratio. The general approach covers Ring-Attention as a special case, and allows the tuning of CommCom ratio with different tile shapes. Importantly, we propose a greedy algorithm that can efficiently search the scheduling space within the tile with restrictions that ensure efficient communication among GPUs. The theoretical analysis shows that Mesh-Attention leads to a much lower communication complexity and exhibits good scalability comparing to other current algorithms.\n  Our extensive experiment results show that Mesh-Attention can achieve up to 3.4x speedup (2.9x on average) and reduce the communication volume by up to 85.4% (79.0% on average) on 256 GPUs. Our scalability results further demonstrate that Mesh-Attention sustains superior performance as the system scales, substantially reducing overhead in large-scale deployments.

We explore this question by designing a prediction task where a crucial latent variable is hidden in relevant image data instead of tabular features. As a result, agentic AI that generates generic codes for modeling tabular data cannot perform well, while human experts could identify the important hidden variable using domain knowledge. We demonstrate this idea with a synthetic dataset for property insurance.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) enhances this process by enabling multi-objective optimization and exploration of novel chemical space - capabilities that traditional supervised learning methods lack. In this work, we introduce \\textbf{ReACT-Drug}, a fully integrated, target-agnostic molecular design framework based on Reinforcement Learning. Unlike models requiring target-specific fine-tuning, ReACT-Drug utilizes a generalist approach by leveraging ESM-2 protein embeddings to identify similar proteins for a given target from a knowledge base such as Protein Data Base (PDB). Thereafter, the known drug ligands corresponding to such proteins are decomposed to initialize a fragment-based search space, biasing the agent towards biologically relevant subspaces. For each such fragment, the pipeline employs a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent guiding a ChemBERTa-encoded molecule through a dynamic action space of chemically valid, reaction-template-based transformations. This results in the generation of \\textit{de novo} drug candidates with competitive binding affinities and high synthetic accessibility, while ensuring 100\\% chemical validity and novelty as per MOSES benchmarking. This architecture highlights the potential of integrating structural biology, deep representation learning, and chemical synthesis rules to automate and accelerate rational drug design.

      "abstract": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced task-solving capabilities in natural language processing with large language models. Unlike standard prompting, CoT encourages the model to generate intermediate reasoning steps, non-answer tokens, that help guide the model toward more accurate final outputs. These intermediate steps enable more complex reasoning processes such as error correction, memory management, future planning, and self-reflection. However, applying CoT to non-natural language domains, such as protein and RNA language models, is not yet possible, primarily due to the limited expressiveness of their token spaces (e.g., amino acid tokens). In this work, we propose and define the concept of language expressiveness: the ability of a given language, using its tokens and grammar, to encode information. We show that the limited expressiveness of protein language severely restricts the applicability of CoT-style reasoning. To overcome this, we introduce reflection pretraining, for the first time in a biological sequence model, which enables the model to engage in intermediate reasoning through the generation of auxiliary \"thinking tokens\" beyond simple answer tokens. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our augmented token set significantly enhances biological language expressiveness, thereby improving the overall reasoning capacity of the model. Experimentally, our pretraining approach teaches protein models to self-correct and leads to substantial performance gains compared to standard pretraining.",

In an era where misinformation spreads rapidly, effective fact-checking is increasingly critical. We introduce TriAligner, a novel approach that leverages a dual-encoder architecture with contrastive learning and incorporates both native and English translations across different modalities. Our method effectively retrieves claims across multiple languages by learning the relative importance of different sources in alignment. To enhance robustness, we employ efficient data preprocessing and augmentation using large language models while incorporating hard negative sampling to improve representation learning.

      "abstract": "Large language models(LLMs) excel at text generation and knowledge question-answering tasks, but they are prone to generating hallucinated content, severely limiting their application in high-risk domains. Current hallucination detection methods based on uncertainty estimation and external knowledge retrieval suffer from the limitation that they still produce erroneous content at high confidence levels and rely heavily on retrieval efficiency and knowledge coverage. In contrast, probe methods that leverage the model's hidden-layer states offer real-time and lightweight advantages. However, traditional linear probes struggle to capture nonlinear structures in deep semantic spaces.To overcome these limitations, we propose a neural network-based framework for token-level hallucination detection. By freezing language model parameters, we employ lightweight MLP probes to perform nonlinear modeling of high-level hidden states. A multi-objective joint loss function is designed to enhance detection stability and semantic disambiguity. Additionally, we establish a layer position-probe performance response model, using Bayesian optimization to automatically search for optimal probe insertion layers and achieve superior training results.Experimental results on LongFact, HealthBench, and TriviaQA demonstrate that MLP probes significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, recall, and detection capability under low false-positive conditions.",

      "abstract": "Data-driven surrogate models are increasingly adopted to accelerate vehicle design. However, open-source multi-fidelity datasets and empirical guidelines linking dataset size to model performance remain limited. This study investigates the relationship between training data size and prediction accuracy for a graph neural network (GNN) based surrogate model for aerodynamic field prediction. We release an open-source, multi-fidelity aerodynamic dataset for double-delta wings, comprising 2448 flow snapshots across 272 geometries evaluated at angles of attack from 11 (degree) to 19 (degree) at Ma=0.3 using both Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) and Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solvers. The geometries are generated using a nested Saltelli sampling scheme to support future dataset expansion and variance-based sensitivity analysis. Using this dataset, we conduct a preliminary empirical scaling study of the MF-VortexNet surrogate by constructing six training datasets with sizes ranging from 40 to 1280 snapshots and training models with 0.1 to 2.4 million parameters under a fixed training budget. We find that the test error decreases with data size with a power-law exponent of -0.6122, indicating efficient data utilization. Based on this scaling law, we estimate that the optimal sampling density is approximately eight samples per dimension in a d-dimensional design space. The results also suggest improved data utilization efficiency for larger surrogate models, implying a potential trade-off between dataset generation cost and model training budget.",

      "abstract": "Spatial reasoning in 3D scenes requires precise geometric calculations that challenge vision-language models. Visual programming addresses this by decomposing problems into steps calling specialized tools, yet existing methods rely on either fixed toolsets or speculative tool induction before solving problems, resulting in suboptimal programs and poor utilization of induced tools. We present Transductive Visual Programming (TVP), a novel framework that builds new tools from its own experience rather than speculation. TVP first solves problems using basic tools while accumulating experiential solutions into an Example Library, then abstracts recurring patterns from these programs into reusable higher-level tools for an evolving Tool Library. This allows TVP to tackle new problems with increasingly powerful tools learned from experience. On Omni3D-Bench, TVP achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming GPT-4o by 22% and the previous best visual programming system by 11%. Our transductively learned tools are used 5x more frequently as core program dependency than inductively created ones, demonstrating more effective tool discovery and reuse. The evolved tools also show strong generalization to unseen spatial tasks, achieving superior performance on benchmarks from SpatialScore-Hard collection without any testset-specific modification. Our work establishes experience-driven transductive tool creation as a powerful paradigm for building self-evolving visual programming agents that effectively tackle challenging spatial reasoning tasks.

      "abstract": "This paper presents a marketing analytics framework that operationalizes subscription pricing as a dynamic, guardrailed decision system, uniting multivariate demand forecasting, segment-level price elasticity, and churn propensity to optimize revenue, margin, and retention. The approach blends seasonal time-series models with tree-based learners, runs Monte Carlo scenario tests to map risk envelopes, and solves a constrained optimization that enforces business guardrails on customer experience, margin floors, and allowable churn. Validated across heterogeneous SaaS portfolios, the method consistently outperforms static tiers and uniform uplifts by reallocating price moves toward segments with higher willingness-to-pay while protecting price-sensitive cohorts. The system is designed for real-time recalibration via modular APIs and includes model explainability for governance and compliance. Managerially, the framework functions as a strategy playbook that clarifies when to shift from flat to dynamic pricing, how to align pricing with CLV and MRR targets, and how to embed ethical guardrails, enabling durable growth without eroding customer trust.",

      "abstract": "Full parameter fine tuning is a key technique for adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, but it incurs substantial memory overhead due to the need to cache extensive intermediate activations for backpropagation. This bottleneck makes full fine tuning of contemporary large scale LLMs challenging in practice. Existing distributed training frameworks such as DeepSpeed alleviate this issue using techniques like ZeRO and FSDP, which rely on multi GPU memory or CPU offloading, but often require additional hardware resources and reduce training speed. We introduce RevFFN, a memory efficient fine tuning paradigm for mixture of experts (MoE) LLMs. RevFFN employs carefully designed reversible Transformer blocks that allow reconstruction of layer input activations from outputs during backpropagation, eliminating the need to store most intermediate activations in memory. While preserving the expressive capacity of MoE architectures, this approach significantly reduces peak memory consumption for full parameter fine tuning. As a result, RevFFN enables efficient full fine tuning on a single consumer grade or server grade GPU.",
