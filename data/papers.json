      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on\nmathemati-cal tasks through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, existing\nmathematical CoT datasets often suffer from Thought Leaps due to experts\nomitting intermediate steps, which negatively impacts model learning and\ngeneralization. We propose the CoT Thought Leap Bridge Task, which aims to\nautomatically detect leaps and generate missing intermediate reasoning steps to\nrestore the completeness and coherence of CoT. To facilitate this, we\nconstructed a specialized training dataset called ScaleQM+, based on the\nstructured ScaleQuestMath dataset, and trained CoT-Bridge to bridge thought\nleaps. Through comprehensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks,\nwe demonstrate that models fine-tuned on bridged datasets consistently\noutperform those trained on original datasets, with improvements of up to\n+5.87% on NuminaMath. Our approach effectively enhances distilled data (+3.02%)\nand provides better starting points for reinforcement learning (+3.1%),\nfunctioning as a plug-and-play module compatible with existing optimization\ntechniques. Furthermore, CoT-Bridge demonstrate improved generalization to\nout-of-domain logical reasoning tasks, confirming that enhancing reasoning\ncompleteness yields broadly applicable benefits.",

      "abstract": "Generative AI search is reshaping information retrieval by offering\nend-to-end answers to complex queries, reducing users' reliance on manually\nbrowsing and summarizing multiple web pages. However, while this paradigm\nenhances convenience, it disrupts the feedback-driven improvement loop that has\nhistorically powered the evolution of traditional Web search. Web search can\ncontinuously improve their ranking models by collecting large-scale,\nfine-grained user feedback (e.g., clicks, dwell time) at the document level. In\ncontrast, generative AI search operates through a much longer search pipeline,\nspanning query decomposition, document retrieval, and answer generation, yet\ntypically receives only coarse-grained feedback on the final answer. This\nintroduces a feedback loop disconnect, where user feedback for the final output\ncannot be effectively mapped back to specific system components, making it\ndifficult to improve each intermediate stage and sustain the feedback loop. In\nthis paper, we envision NExT-Search, a next-generation paradigm designed to\nreintroduce fine-grained, process-level feedback into generative AI search.\nNExT-Search integrates two complementary modes: User Debug Mode, which allows\nengaged users to intervene at key stages; and Shadow User Mode, where a\npersonalized user agent simulates user preferences and provides AI-assisted\nfeedback for less interactive users. Furthermore, we envision how these\nfeedback signals can be leveraged through online adaptation, which refines\ncurrent search outputs in real-time, and offline update, which aggregates\ninteraction logs to periodically fine-tune query decomposition, retrieval, and\ngeneration models. By restoring human control over key stages of the generative\nAI search pipeline, we believe NExT-Search offers a promising direction for\nbuilding feedback-rich AI search systems that can evolve continuously alongside\nhuman feedback.",

Existing safety alignment methods reduce\nharmful outputs but can degrade reasoning depth, leading to significant\ntrade-offs in complex, multi-step tasks, and remain vulnerable to sophisticated\njailbreak attacks. To address this, we introduce SAFEPATH, a lightweight\nalignment method that fine-tunes LRMs to emit a short, 8-token Safety Primer at\nthe start of their reasoning, in response to harmful prompts, while leaving the\nrest of the reasoning process unsupervised. Empirical results across multiple\nbenchmarks indicate that SAFEPATH effectively reduces harmful outputs while\nmaintaining reasoning performance. Specifically, SAFEPATH reduces harmful\nresponses by up to 90.0% and blocks 83.3% of jailbreak attempts in the\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B model, while requiring 295.9x less compute than\nDirect Refusal and 314.1x less than SafeChain.

Furthermore, we show that even when models are\nexplicitly optimized against stylistic detectors, detection performance remains\nsurprisingly unaffected.

To study this question, we explore a new paraphrasing\napproach that simultaneously aims to close the gap between human writing and\nmachine writing in stylistic feature space while avoiding detection using\ntraditional features. We show that when only a single sample is available for\ndetection, this attack is universally effective across all detectors\nconsidered, including those that use writing style. However, as the number of\nsamples available for detection grows, the human and machine distributions\nbecome distinguishable.

Recently, several works proposed the use of reputation for the design\nand scalability improvement of decentralized (blockchain) ledgers; however,\nsuch systems are prone to manipulation and to our knowledge no game-theoretic\ntreatment exists that can support their economic robustness.\n  In this work we put forth a new model for the design of what we call, {\\em\ntrustworthy reputation systems}. Concretely, we describe a class of games,\nwhich we term {\\em trustworthy reputation games}, that enable a set of users to\nreport a function of their beliefs about the trustworthiness of each server in\na set -- i.e., their estimate of the probability that this server will behave\naccording to its specified strategy -- in a way that satisfies the following\nproperties:\n  1. It is $(\\epsilon$-)best response for any rational user in the game to play\na prescribed (truthful) strategy according to their true belief.\n  2. Assuming that the users' beliefs are not too far from the {\\em true}\ntrustworthiness of the servers, playing the above ($\\epsilon-$)Nash equilibrium\nallows anyone who observes the users' strategies to estimate the relative\ntrustworthiness of any two servers.\n  Our utilities and decoding function build on a connection between the well\nknown PageRank algorithm and the problem of trustworthiness discovery, which\ncan be of independent interest.

Attention is a\npowerful cognitive ability that allows agents to focus on potentially complex\ninformation, such as logically structured propositions, higher-order beliefs,\nor what other agents pay attention to. This ability is a strength, as it helps\nto ignore what is irrelevant, but it can also introduce biases when some types\nof information or agents are systematically ignored. Existing dynamic epistemic\nlogics for attention cannot model such complex attention scenarios, as they\nonly model attention to atomic formulas. Additionally, such logics quickly\nbecome cumbersome, as their size grows exponentially in the number of agents\nand announced literals. Here, we introduce a logic that overcomes both\nlimitations. First, we generalize edge-conditioned event models, which we show\nto be as expressive as standard event models yet exponentially more succinct\n(generalizing both standard event models and generalized arrow updates).\nSecond, we extend attention to arbitrary formulas, allowing agents to also\nattend to other agents' beliefs or attention.

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) struggle with formal domains that require\nrigorous logical deduction and symbolic reasoning, such as mathematical proof\ngeneration. We propose a neuro-symbolic approach that combines LLMs' generative\nstrengths with structured components to overcome this challenge. As a\nproof-of-concept, we focus on geometry problems. Our approach is two-fold: (1)\nwe retrieve analogous problems and use their proofs to guide the LLM, and (2) a\nformal verifier evaluates the generated proofs and provides feedback, helping\nthe model fix incorrect proofs. We demonstrate that our method significantly\nimproves proof accuracy for OpenAI's o1 model (58%-70% improvement); both\nanalogous problems and the verifier's feedback contribute to these gains. More\nbroadly, shifting to LLMs that generate provably correct conclusions could\ndramatically improve their reliability, accuracy and consistency, unlocking\ncomplex tasks and critical real-world applications that require\ntrustworthiness.",

      "abstract": "Although autoregressive models have dominated language modeling in recent\nyears, there has been a growing interest in exploring alternative paradigms to\nthe conventional next-token prediction framework. Diffusion-based language\nmodels have emerged as a compelling alternative due to their powerful parallel\ngeneration capabilities and inherent editability. However, these models are\noften constrained by fixed-length generation. A promising direction is to\ncombine the strengths of both paradigms, segmenting sequences into blocks,\nmodeling autoregressive dependencies across blocks while leveraging discrete\ndiffusion to estimate the conditional distribution within each block given the\npreceding context. Nevertheless, their practical application is often hindered\nby two key limitations: rigid fixed-length outputs and a lack of flexible\ncontrol mechanisms. In this work, we address the critical limitations of fixed\ngranularity and weak controllability in current large diffusion language\nmodels. We propose CtrlDiff, a dynamic and controllable semi-autoregressive\nframework that adaptively determines the size of each generation block based on\nlocal semantics using reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we introduce a\nclassifier-guided control mechanism tailored to discrete diffusion, which\nsignificantly reduces computational overhead while facilitating efficient\npost-hoc conditioning without retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat CtrlDiff sets a new standard among hybrid diffusion models, narrows the\nperformance gap to state-of-the-art autoregressive approaches, and enables\neffective conditional text generation across diverse tasks.",

Consequently, a key research challenge is to transcend traditional\nknowledge transfer paradigms rooted in symbolic language and achieve genuine\nParametric Knowledge Transfer (PKT). Significantly, exploring effective methods\nfor transferring knowledge across LLMs of different scales through parameters\npresents an intriguing and valuable research direction. In this paper, we first\ndemonstrate $\\textbf{Alignment}$ in parametric space is the fundamental\nprerequisite to achieve successful cross-scale PKT. We redefine the previously\nexplored knowledge transfer as Post-Align PKT (PostPKT), which utilizes\nextracted parameters for LoRA initialization and requires subsequent fine-tune\nfor alignment.
