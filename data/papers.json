      "abstract": "The rapid expansion of interconnected devices, autonomous systems, and AI\napplications has created severe fragmentation in adaptive transport systems,\nwhere diverse protocols and context sources remain isolated. This survey\nprovides the first systematic investigation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)\nas a unifying paradigm, highlighting its ability to bridge protocol-level\nadaptation with context-aware decision making. Analyzing established\nliterature, we show that existing efforts have implicitly converged toward\nMCP-like architectures, signaling a natural evolution from fragmented solutions\nto standardized integration frameworks. We propose a five-category taxonomy\ncovering adaptive mechanisms, context-aware frameworks, unification models,\nintegration strategies, and MCP-enabled architectures. Our findings reveal\nthree key insights: traditional transport protocols have reached the limits of\nisolated adaptation, MCP's client-server and JSON-RPC structure enables\nsemantic interoperability, and AI-driven transport demands integration\nparadigms uniquely suited to MCP. Finally, we present a research roadmap\npositioning MCP as a foundation for next-generation adaptive, context-aware,\nand intelligent transport infrastructures.",

      "abstract": "As models increasingly leverage multi-step reasoning strategies to solve\ncomplex problems, supervising the logical validity of these intermediate steps\nhas become a critical research challenge. Process reward models address this by\nproviding step-by-step feedback, but current approaches have two major\ndrawbacks: they typically function as classifiers without providing\nexplanations, and their reliance on supervised fine-tuning with static datasets\nlimits generalization. Inspired by recent advances, we reframe stepwise reward\nmodeling from a classification task to a reasoning task itself. We thus propose\na generative judge that reasons about the policy model's reasoning steps (i.e.,\nmeta-reasons), outputting thinking tokens before delivering a final verdict.\nOur model, StepWiser, is trained by reinforcement learning using relative\noutcomes of rollouts. We show it provides (i) better judgment accuracy on\nintermediate steps than existing methods; (ii) can be used to improve the\npolicy model at training time; and (iii) improves inference-time search.",

However, most systems remain constrained by a linear\nrequest-response format that often makes interactions inefficient in\nmulti-turn, information-dense, and exploratory tasks. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Generative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigm\nin which LLMs respond to user queries by proactively generating user interfaces\n(UIs) that enable more adaptive and interactive engagement. Our framework\nleverages structured interface-specific representations and iterative\nrefinements to translate user queries into task-specific UIs. For systematic\nevaluation, we introduce a multidimensional assessment framework that compares\ngenerative interfaces with traditional chat-based ones across diverse tasks,\ninteraction patterns, and query types, capturing functional, interactive, and\nemotional aspects of user experience. Results show that generative interfaces\nconsistently outperform conversational ones, with humans preferring them in\nover 70% of cases. These findings clarify when and why users favor generative\ninterfaces, paving the way for future advancements in human-AI interaction.",

To address this limitation, we propose INSIDE\n(Interpolating Speaker Identities in Embedding Space), a novel data expansion\nmethod that synthesizes new speaker identities by interpolating between\nexisting speaker embeddings. Specifically, we select pairs of nearby speaker\nembeddings from a pretrained speaker embedding space and compute intermediate\nembeddings using spherical linear interpolation.

The resulting data is combined with the original dataset to train\ndownstream models. Experiments show that models trained with INSIDE-expanded\ndata outperform those trained only on real data, achieving 3.06\\% to 5.24\\%\nrelative improvements. While INSIDE is primarily designed for speaker\nverification, we also validate its effectiveness on gender classification,\nwhere it yields a 13.44\\% relative improvement.

Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of\nreconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor\ndata. However, these methods have baked-in static environments and only allow\nfor limited scene control -- they are functionally constrained in scene and\ntrajectory diversity by the captures from which they are reconstructed. In\ncontrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models\noffers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In\nthis work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly\ngenerates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for\ncausal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry\nestimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and\nenvironment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image\npriors.

This work provides the first formal\nproof that TIR fundamentally expands an LLM's capabilities. We demonstrate that\ntools enable a strict expansion of the model's empirical and feasible support,\nbreaking the capability ceiling of pure-text models by unlocking\nproblem-solving strategies that are otherwise impossible or intractably\nverbose. To guide model behavior without compromising training stability and\nperformance, we also introduce Advantage Shaping Policy Optimization (ASPO), a\nnovel algorithm that directly modifies the advantage function to guide the\npolicy behavior. We conduct comprehensive experiments on challenging\nmathematical benchmarks, leveraging a Python interpreter as the external tool.\nOur results show that the TIR model decisively outperforms its pure-text\ncounterpart on the pass@k metric. Crucially, this advantage is not confined to\ncomputationally-intensive problems but extends to those requiring significant\nabstract insight.

      "abstract": "We present the RAW domain diffusion model (RDDM), an end-to-end diffusion\nmodel that restores photo-realistic images directly from the sensor RAW data.\nWhile recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are\ncaught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these\nmodels process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor\nRAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge\ndevices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by\ndirectly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional\ntwo-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple\nadaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the\nout-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE\n(RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone\nProcessing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To\ncompensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation\npipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for\nlarge-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB)\nLoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion\nmethods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.",

      "abstract": "Contemporary artificial intelligence (AI) development largely centers on\nrational decision-making, valued for its measurability and suitability for\nobjective evaluation. Yet in real-world contexts, an intelligent agent's\ndecisions are shaped not only by logic but also by deeper influences such as\nbeliefs, values, and preferences. The diversity of human decision-making styles\nemerges from these differences, highlighting that \"style\" is an essential but\noften overlooked dimension of intelligence.\n  This dissertation introduces playstyle as an alternative lens for observing\nand analyzing the decision-making behavior of intelligent agents, and examines\nits foundational meaning and historical context from a philosophical\nperspective. By analyzing how beliefs and values drive intentions and actions,\nwe construct a two-tier framework for style formation: the external interaction\nloop with the environment and the internal cognitive loop of deliberation. On\nthis basis, we formalize style-related characteristics and propose measurable\nindicators such as style capacity, style popularity, and evolutionary dynamics.\n  The study focuses on three core research directions: (1) Defining and\nmeasuring playstyle, proposing a general playstyle metric based on discretized\nstate spaces, and extending it to quantify strategic diversity and competitive\nbalance; (2) Expressing and generating playstyle, exploring how reinforcement\nlearning and imitation learning can be used to train agents exhibiting specific\nstylistic tendencies, and introducing a novel approach for human-like style\nlearning and modeling; and (3) Practical applications, analyzing the potential\nof these techniques in domains such as game design and interactive\nentertainment.\n  Finally, the dissertation outlines future extensions, including the role of\nstyle as a core element in building artificial general intelligence (AGI).",

While post-training methods have improved\nLLM performance, they still fall short in capturing deep procedural logic on\ncomplex tasks. To tackle the issue, in this paper, we first investigate this\nlimitation and uncover a novel finding: a Scaling Law by Difficulty, which\nreveals that model performance follows a U-shaped curve with respect to\ntraining data complexity -- excessive low-difficulty data impedes abstraction,\nwhile high-difficulty data significantly enhances reasoning ability. Motivated\nby this, we propose the Structured Solution Template (SST) framework, which\nuses solution templates and a curriculum of varied difficulty to explicitly\nteach procedural reasoning. Specifically, SST comprises (1) fine-tuning with\nstructured solution-template chains and dynamically weighted loss to prioritize\nprocedural logic, (2) prompt-time injection of solution templates as cognitive\nscaffolds to guide inference, and (3) integrated curriculum fine-tuning that\nexplicitly teaches the model to self-plan - execute - self-correct. Experiments\non GSM8K, AIME24, and new Dynamic En benchmark show that SST significantly\nimproves both accuracy and efficiency, especially on harder problems.",

The majority of\ncurrent approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or\nlearned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering\nstrategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually\ndesigned features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better\nthan the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based\napproaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not\ntruly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second\nis that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,\nleading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric\ncharacteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network\ntraining. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,\nnamed RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds\nin a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer\nencoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance\nmasks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the\nsegmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module\n(EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to\nenhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition,\nwe propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the\ninfluence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss\nto constrain the network training.",

This paper presents DistillPrompt -- a novel autoprompting\nmethod based on large language models that employs a multi-stage integration of\ntask-specific information into prompts using training data. DistillPrompt\nutilizes distillation, compression, and aggregation operations to explore the\nprompt space more thoroughly. The method was tested on different datasets for\ntext classification and generation tasks using the t-lite-instruct-0.1 language\nmodel. The results demonstrate a significant average improvement (e.g., 20.12%\nacross the entire dataset compared to Grips) in key metrics over existing\nmethods in the field, establishing DistillPrompt as one of the most effective\nnon-gradient approaches in autoprompting.",

Unlike post-hoc\nexplanation methods, our approach embeds reasoning directly into the model's\nrepresentations: symbols capture meaningful semantic patterns, chains trace\ndecision paths, and gated induction mechanisms guide selective focus, yielding\ntransparent yet flexible reasoning. We introduce complementary training\nobjectives to enhance symbol purity and decision sparsity, and employ a\nsequential specialization strategy to first build broad symbolic competence and\nthen refine intuitive judgments.

As a result, this design reduces memory usage and data transfer,\nwhile largely eliminating PCIe overhead.

Modern forecasting models are generally opaque and do\nnot provide explanations for their forecasts, while well-known post-hoc\nexplainability methods like LIME are not suitable for the forecasting context.\nWe propose PAX-TS, a model-agnostic post-hoc algorithm to explain time series\nforecasting models and their forecasts. Our method is based on localized input\nperturbations and results in multi-granular explanations. Further, it is able\nto characterize cross-channel correlations for multivariate time series\nforecasts. We clearly outline the algorithmic procedure behind PAX-TS,\ndemonstrate it on a benchmark with 7 algorithms and 10 diverse datasets,\ncompare it with two other state-of-the-art explanation algorithms, and present\nthe different explanation types of the method. We found that the explanations\nof high-performing and low-performing algorithms differ on the same datasets,\nhighlighting that the explanations of PAX-TS effectively capture a model's\nbehavior. Based on time step correlation matrices resulting from the benchmark,\nwe identify 6 classes of patterns that repeatedly occur across different\ndatasets and algorithms. We found that the patterns are indicators of\nperformance, with noticeable differences in forecasting error between the\nclasses. Lastly, we outline a multivariate example where PAX-TS demonstrates\nhow the forecasting model takes cross-channel correlations into account.

Among them\nare hallucination effects, high computational complexity of training and\ninference, costly fine-tuning, and catastrophic forgetting issues. These\nlimitations significantly hinder the use of neural networks in critical areas\nsuch as medicine, industrial process management, and scientific research. This\narticle proposes an alternative approach based on the nearest neighbors method\nwith hierarchical clustering structures. Employing the k-nearest neighbors\nalgorithm significantly reduces or completely eliminates hallucination effects\nwhile simplifying model expansion and fine-tuning without the need for\nretraining the entire network. To overcome the high computational load of the\nk-nearest neighbors method, the paper proposes using tree-like data structures\nbased on Kohonen self-organizing maps, thereby greatly accelerating nearest\nneighbor searches. Tests conducted on handwritten digit recognition and simple\nsubtitle translation tasks confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed\napproach. With only a slight reduction in accuracy, the nearest neighbor search\ntime was reduced hundreds of times compared to exhaustive search methods.

      "abstract": "Automated detection of vulnerabilities in source code is an essential\ncybersecurity challenge, underpinning trust in digital systems and services.\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach as they can\nlearn structural and logical code relationships in a data-driven manner.\nHowever, their performance is severely constrained by training data imbalances\nand label noise. GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code\nsimilarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen\nreal-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and\ninterpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious\ncorrelations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.\nCounterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite\nlabels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a\nLarge Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples\nwith opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the\ncrucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring\nspurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more\nrobust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to\n97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group\naccuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20\nvulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class\nattribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score\ndependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real\nand counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category.
