      "abstract": "Mobile robots navigating in crowds trained using reinforcement learning are\nknown to suffer performance degradation when faced with out-of-distribution\nscenarios. We propose that by properly accounting for the uncertainties of\npedestrians, a robot can learn safe navigation policies that are robust to\ndistribution shifts. Our method augments agent observations with prediction\nuncertainty estimates generated by adaptive conformal inference, and it uses\nthese estimates to guide the agent's behavior through constrained reinforcement\nlearning. The system helps regulate the agent's actions and enables it to adapt\nto distribution shifts. In the in-distribution setting, our approach achieves a\n96.93% success rate, which is over 8.80% higher than the previous\nstate-of-the-art baselines with over 3.72 times fewer collisions and 2.43 times\nfewer intrusions into ground-truth human future trajectories. In three\nout-of-distribution scenarios, our method shows much stronger robustness when\nfacing distribution shifts in velocity variations, policy changes, and\ntransitions from individual to group dynamics. We deploy our method on a real\nrobot, and experiments show that the robot makes safe and robust decisions when\ninteracting with both sparse and dense crowds.

These unique characteristics introduce new\nchallenges that differentiate live streaming recommendation from traditional\nrecommendation settings and have garnered increasing attention from industry in\nrecent years. However, research progress in academia has been hindered by the\nlack of publicly available datasets that accurately reflect the dynamic nature\nof live streaming environments. To address this gap, we introduce KuaiLive, the\nfirst real-time, interactive dataset collected from Kuaishou, a leading live\nstreaming platform in China with over 400 million daily active users. The\ndataset records the interaction logs of 23,772 users and 452,621 streamers over\na 21-day period. Compared to existing datasets, KuaiLive offers several\nadvantages: it includes precise live room start and end timestamps, multiple\ntypes of real-time user interactions (click, comment, like, gift), and rich\nside information features for both users and streamers. These features enable\nmore realistic simulation of dynamic candidate items and better modeling of\nuser and streamer behaviors. We conduct a thorough analysis of KuaiLive from\nmultiple perspectives and evaluate several representative recommendation\nmethods on it, establishing a strong benchmark for future research. KuaiLive\ncan support a wide range of tasks in the live streaming domain, such as top-K\nrecommendation, click-through rate prediction, watch time prediction, and gift\nprice prediction. Moreover, its fine-grained behavioral data also enables\nresearch on multi-behavior modeling, multi-task learning, and fairness-aware\nrecommendation.

Recent work has used linear probes, lightweight tools for analyzing\nmodel representations, to study various LLM skills such as the ability to model\nuser sentiment and political perspective. Motivated by this, we apply probes to\nstudy persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. We leverage\ninsights from cognitive science to train probes on distinct aspects of\npersuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy.\nDespite their simplicity, we show that they capture various aspects of\npersuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. For instance, probes can\nidentify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where\npersuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. We also show\nthat in addition to being faster than expensive prompting-based approaches,\nprobes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such\nas when uncovering persuasion strategy.

To address these challenges, we\nintroduce LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment. To explore\nhuman-like learning dynamics, we construct learners with psychologically\ngrounded profiles-such as Deep, Surface, and Lazy-as well as a persona-free\nGeneral Learner to inspect the base LLM's default behavior. Through weekly\nknowledge acquisition, monthly strategic choices, periodic tests, and peer\ninteraction, we can track the dynamic learning progress of individual learners\nover a full-year journey.

Our\nspecially designed \"trap questions\" effectively diagnose Surface Learner's\nshallow knowledge. 2) The behavioral and cognitive patterns of distinct\nlearners align closely with their psychological profiles. 3) Learners'\nself-concept scores evolve realistically, with the General Learner developing\nsurprisingly high self-efficacy despite its cognitive limitations. 4)\nCritically, the default profile of base LLM is a \"diligent but brittle Surface\nLearner\"-an agent that mimics the behaviors of a good student but lacks true,\ngeneralizable understanding.

      "abstract": "This paper argues that Active Inference (AIF) provides a crucial foundation\nfor developing autonomous AI agents capable of learning from experience without\ncontinuous human reward engineering. As AI systems begin to exhaust\nhigh-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for\nreward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges\nthat could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The\nproposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated\ndata, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on\nextensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the\nbottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we\nidentify as the \\textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI\nsystems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to\nchanging circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing\nexternal reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy,\nallowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a\nunified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative\nworld models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create\nagents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with\nhuman values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that\ncan develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical\nconstraints.",

To enhance their utility while preserving\ndata efficiency, recent research has increasingly focused on unsupervised\nadaptation methods that do not rely on labeled data. Despite the growing\ninterest in this area, there remains a lack of a unified, task-oriented survey\ndedicated to unsupervised VLM adaptation. To bridge this gap, we present a\ncomprehensive and structured overview of the field.

Within this framework, we\nanalyze core methodologies and adaptation strategies associated with each\nparadigm, aiming to establish a systematic understanding of the field.\nAdditionally, we review representative benchmarks across diverse applications\nand highlight open challenges and promising directions for future research.

Inspired by Cartesian principles from\n\\textit{Discours de la m\\'ethode}, this paper introduces Logic-Augmented\nGeneration (LAG), a novel paradigm that reframes knowledge augmentation through\nsystematic question decomposition and dependency-aware reasoning. Specifically,\nLAG first decomposes complex questions into atomic sub-questions ordered by\nlogical dependencies.

To prevent error propagation, LAG incorporates a\nlogical termination mechanism that halts inference upon encountering\nunanswerable sub-questions and reduces wasted computation on excessive\nreasoning. Finally, it synthesizes all sub-resolutions to generate verified\nresponses. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that LAG\nsignificantly enhances reasoning robustness, reduces hallucination, and aligns\nLLM problem-solving with human cognition, offering a principled alternative to\nexisting RAG systems.",

      "abstract": "Neural networks excel across a wide range of tasks, yet remain black boxes.\nIn particular, how their internal representations are shaped by the complexity\nof the input data and the problems they solve remains obscure. In this work, we\nintroduce a suite of five data-agnostic probes-pruning, binarization, noise\ninjection, sign flipping, and bipartite network randomization-to quantify how\ntask difficulty influences the topology and robustness of representations in\nmultilayer perceptrons (MLPs). MLPs are represented as signed, weighted\nbipartite graphs from a network science perspective. We contrast easy and hard\nclassification tasks on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. We show that\nbinarizing weights in hard-task models collapses accuracy to chance, whereas\neasy-task models remain robust. We also find that pruning low-magnitude edges\nin binarized hard-task models reveals a sharp phase-transition in performance.\nMoreover, moderate noise injection can enhance accuracy, resembling a\nstochastic-resonance effect linked to optimal sign flips of small-magnitude\nweights. Finally, preserving only the sign structure-instead of precise weight\nmagnitudes-through bipartite network randomizations suffices to maintain high\naccuracy. These phenomena define a model- and modality-agnostic measure of task\ncomplexity: the performance gap between full-precision and binarized or\nshuffled neural network performance. Our findings highlight the crucial role of\nsigned bipartite topology in learned representations and suggest practical\nstrategies for model compression and interpretability that align with task\ncomplexity.",

These approaches fail to provide rigorous\ntail-safety guarantees with respect to extreme or high-risk outcomes (denoted\nas tail-risk), potentially resulting in serious consequence in high-stake\nscenarios. This paper addresses the problem by developing two novel solutions.\nWe first propose CVaR-MCTS, which embeds a coherent tail risk measure,\nConditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), into MCTS. Our CVaR-MCTS with parameter\n$\\alpha$ achieves explicit tail-risk control over the expected loss in the\n\"worst $(1-\\alpha)\\%$ scenarios.\" Second, we further address the estimation\nbias of tail-risk due to limited samples. We propose Wasserstein-MCTS (or\nW-MCTS) by introducing a first-order Wasserstein ambiguity set\n$\\mathcal{P}_{\\varepsilon_{s}}(s,a)$ with radius $\\varepsilon_{s}$ to\ncharacterize the uncertainty in tail-risk estimates. We prove PAC tail-safety\nguarantees for both CVaR-MCTS and W-MCTS and establish their regret.\nEvaluations on diverse simulated environments demonstrate that our proposed\nmethods outperform existing baselines, effectively achieving robust tail-risk\nguarantees with improved rewards and stability.",

A critical yet\nunderexplored aspect of this task is the effective use of patient-specific\nprior knowledge -- including clinical context (e.g., symptoms, medical history)\nand the most recent prior image -- which radiologists routinely rely on for\ndiagnostic reasoning. Most existing methods generate reports from single\nimages, neglecting this essential prior information and thus failing to capture\ndiagnostic intent or disease progression. To bridge this gap, we propose\nPriorRG, a novel chest X-ray report generation framework that emulates\nreal-world clinical workflows via a two-stage training pipeline. In Stage 1, we\nintroduce a prior-guided contrastive pre-training scheme that leverages\nclinical context to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction, allowing the model\nto align more closely with the intrinsic spatiotemporal semantics in radiology\nreports. In Stage 2, we present a prior-aware coarse-to-fine decoding for\nreport generation that progressively integrates patient-specific prior\nknowledge with the vision encoder's hidden states. This decoding allows the\nmodel to align with diagnostic focus and track disease progression, thereby\nenhancing the clinical accuracy and fluency of the generated reports. Extensive\nexperiments on MIMIC-CXR and MIMIC-ABN datasets demonstrate that PriorRG\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 3.6% BLEU-4 and 3.8% F1 score\nimprovement on MIMIC-CXR, and a 5.9% BLEU-1 gain on MIMIC-ABN.

Effectively integrating diverse user behavior patterns\nwith rich multimodal information of items to enhance the accuracy of sequential\nrecommendations is an emerging and challenging research direction. This paper\nfocuses on the problem of multi-modal multi-behavior sequential recommendation,\naiming to address the following challenges: (1) the lack of effective\ncharacterization of modal preferences across different behaviors, as user\nattention to different item modalities varies depending on the behavior; (2)\nthe difficulty of effectively mitigating implicit noise in user behavior, such\nas unintended actions like accidental clicks; (3) the inability to handle\nmodality noise in multi-modal representations, which further impacts the\naccurate modeling of user preferences. To tackle these issues, we propose a\nnovel Multi-Modal Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation model (M$^3$BSR).\nThis model first removes noise in multi-modal representations using a\nConditional Diffusion Modality Denoising Layer. Subsequently, it utilizes deep\nbehavioral information to guide the denoising of shallow behavioral data,\nthereby alleviating the impact of noise in implicit feedback through\nConditional Diffusion Behavior Denoising. Finally, by introducing a\nMulti-Expert Interest Extraction Layer, M$^3$BSR explicitly models the common\nand specific interests across behaviors and modalities to enhance\nrecommendation performance.
