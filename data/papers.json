      "abstract": "Planning with world models offers a powerful paradigm for robotic control.\nConventional approaches train a model to predict future frames conditioned on\ncurrent frames and actions, which can then be used for planning. However, the\nobjective of predicting future pixels is often at odds with the actual planning\nobjective; strong pixel reconstruction does not always correlate with good\nplanning decisions. This paper posits that instead of reconstructing future\nframes as pixels, world models only need to predict task-relevant semantic\ninformation about the future. For such prediction the paper poses world\nmodeling as a visual question answering problem about semantic information in\nfuture frames. This perspective allows world modeling to be approached with the\nsame tools underlying vision language models. Thus vision language models can\nbe trained as \"semantic\" world models through a supervised finetuning process\non image-action-text data, enabling planning for decision-making while\ninheriting many of the generalization and robustness properties from the\npretrained vision-language models. The paper demonstrates how such a semantic\nworld model can be used for policy improvement on open-ended robotics tasks,\nleading to significant generalization improvements over typical paradigms of\nreconstruction-based action-conditional world modeling.

      "abstract": "Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards has emerged as a powerful\ntechnique for enhancing the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language\nModels (LLMs). However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the\n''learning cliff'' phenomenon: when faced with problems far beyond their\ncurrent capabilities, models consistently fail, yielding a persistent\nzero-reward signal. In policy optimization algorithms like GRPO, this collapses\nthe advantage calculation to zero, rendering these difficult problems invisible\nto the learning gradient and stalling progress. To overcome this, we introduce\nScaf-GRPO (Scaffolded Group Relative Policy Optimization), a progressive\ntraining framework that strategically provides minimal guidance only when a\nmodel's independent learning has plateaued. The framework first diagnoses\nlearning stagnation and then intervenes by injecting tiered in-prompt hints,\nranging from abstract concepts to concrete steps, enabling the model to\nconstruct a valid solution by itself. Extensive experiments on challenging\nmathematics benchmarks demonstrate Scaf-GRPO's effectiveness, boosting the\npass@1 score of the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model on the AIME24 benchmark by a relative\n44.3% over a vanilla GRPO baseline. This result demonstrates our framework\nprovides a robust and effective methodology for unlocking a model's ability to\nsolve problems previously beyond its reach, a critical step towards extending\nthe frontier of autonomous reasoning in LLM.",

The effectiveness of SD hinges on the alignment\nbetween these models, which is typically enhanced by Knowledge Distillation\n(KD). However, conventional KD methods aim to minimize the KL divergence\nbetween the draft and target models across all tokens, a goal that is\nmisaligned with the true objective of SD, which is to maximize token acceptance\nrate. Therefore, draft models often struggle to fully assimilate the target\nmodel's knowledge due to capacity constraints, leading to suboptimal\nperformance. To address this challenge, we propose AdaSPEC, a novel method that\nincorporates selective token filtering into the KD process. AdaSPEC utilizes a\nreference model to identify and filter out difficult-to-fit tokens, enabling\nthe distillation of a draft model that better aligns with the target model on\nsimpler tokens. This approach improves the overall token acceptance rate\nwithout compromising generation quality. We evaluate AdaSPEC across diverse\ntasks, including arithmetic reasoning, instruction-following, coding, and\nsummarization, using model configurations of 31M/1.4B and 350M/2.7B parameters.\nOur results demonstrate that AdaSPEC consistently outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art DistillSpec method, achieving higher acceptance rates across\nall tasks (up to 15\\%).

Yet many LLM-based approaches ignore interactions among rules, and\nthe opportunity to couple LLMs with probabilistic rule learning for robust\ninference remains underexplored. We present RLIE, a unified framework that\nintegrates LLMs with probabilistic modeling to learn a set of weighted rules.\nRLIE has four stages: (1) Rule generation, where an LLM proposes and filters\ncandidates; (2) Logistic regression, which learns probabilistic weights for\nglobal selection and calibration; (3) Iterative refinement, which updates the\nrule set using prediction errors; and (4) Evaluation, which compares the\nweighted rule set as a direct classifier with methods that inject rules into an\nLLM. We evaluate multiple inference strategies on real-world datasets. Applying\nrules directly with their learned weights yields superior performance, whereas\nprompting LLMs with the rules, weights, and logistic-model outputs surprisingly\ndegrades accuracy. This supports the view that LLMs excel at semantic\ngeneration and interpretation but are less reliable for precise probabilistic\nintegration. RLIE clarifies the potential and limitations of LLMs for inductive\nreasoning and couples them with classic probabilistic rule combination methods\nto enable more reliable neuro-symbolic reasoning.",

      "abstract": "Human communication is motivated: people speak, write, and create content\nwith a particular communicative intent in mind. As a result, information that\nlarge language models (LLMs) and AI agents process is inherently framed by\nhumans' intentions and incentives. People are adept at navigating such nuanced\ninformation: we routinely identify benevolent or self-serving motives in order\nto decide what statements to trust. For LLMs to be effective in the real world,\nthey too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of\nthe source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales\npitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have\nthis capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled\nexperiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent\nwith rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they\nsuccessfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner.\nWe then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic\nreflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems. In these settings, we find\nthat LLMs' inferences do not track the rational models' predictions nearly as\nclosely -- partly due to additional information that distracts them from\nvigilance-relevant considerations. However, a simple steering intervention that\nboosts the salience of intentions and incentives substantially increases the\ncorrespondence between LLMs and the rational model. These results suggest that\nLLMs possess a basic sensitivity to the motivations of others, but generalizing\nto novel real-world settings will require further improvements to these models.",

Yet, researchers are often sidetracked by the manual,\nrepetitive chore of building project webpages to make their dense papers\naccessible. While automation has tackled static slides and posters, the\ndynamic, interactive nature of webpages has remained an unaddressed challenge.\nTo bridge this gap, we reframe the problem, arguing that the solution lies not\nin a single command, but in a collaborative, hierarchical process. We introduce\n$\\textbf{AutoPage}$, a novel multi-agent system that embodies this philosophy.\nAutoPage deconstructs paper-to-page creation into a coarse-to-fine pipeline\nfrom narrative planning to multimodal content generation and interactive\nrendering. To combat AI hallucination, dedicated \"Checker\" agents verify each\nstep against the source paper, while optional human checkpoints ensure the\nfinal product aligns perfectly with the author's vision, transforming the\nsystem from a mere tool into a powerful collaborative assistant. To rigorously\nvalidate our approach, we also construct $\\textbf{PageBench}$, the first\nbenchmark for this new task. Experiments show AutoPage not only generates\nhigh-quality, visually appealing pages but does so with remarkable efficiency\nin under 15 minutes for less than \\$0.1.

      "abstract": "Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a crucial aspect of incident management in\nlarge-scale cloud services. While the term root cause analysis or RCA has been\nwidely used, different studies formulate the task differently. This is because\nthe term \"RCA\" implicitly covers tasks with distinct underlying goals. For\ninstance, the goal of localizing a faulty service for rapid triage is\nfundamentally different from identifying a specific functional bug for a\ndefinitive fix. However, previous surveys have largely overlooked these\ngoal-based distinctions, conventionally categorizing papers by input data types\n(e.g., metric-based vs. trace-based methods). This leads to the grouping of\nworks with disparate objectives, thereby obscuring the true progress and gaps\nin the field. Meanwhile, the typical audience of an RCA survey is either laymen\nwho want to know the goals and big picture of the task or RCA researchers who\nwant to figure out past research under the same task formulation. Thus, an RCA\nsurvey that organizes the related papers according to their goals is in high\ndemand. To this end, this paper presents a goal-driven framework that\neffectively categorizes and integrates 135 papers on RCA in the context of\ncloud incident management based on their diverse goals, spanning the period\nfrom 2014 to 2025. In addition to the goal-driven categorization, it discusses\nthe ultimate goal of all RCA papers as an umbrella covering different RCA\nformulations. Moreover, the paper discusses open challenges and future\ndirections in RCA.",

Earth Observation (EO) represents a\nquintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote\nsensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data\nintroduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor\nmodalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex\nbased on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this\ncontext, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the\nvast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve\nsingle-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research\nefforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular\ndownstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To\naddress this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of\ngeneralizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for\ninference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative\nlearning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal\nmodel manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We\nevaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and\nregression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the\nmodalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our\nresults demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art\napproaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as\nwell as EO-specific methods. The obtained findings validate our framework in\nthe single-modality inference scenarios across a diverse range of EO\napplications.",

      "abstract": "Imitation learning has proven effective for training robots to perform\ncomplex tasks from expert human demonstrations. However, it remains limited by\nits reliance on high-quality, task-specific data, restricting adaptability to\nthe diverse range of real-world object configurations and scenarios. In\ncontrast, non-expert data -- such as play data, suboptimal demonstrations,\npartial task completions, or rollouts from suboptimal policies -- can offer\nbroader coverage and lower collection costs. However, conventional imitation\nlearning approaches fail to utilize this data effectively. To address these\nchallenges, we posit that with right design decisions, offline reinforcement\nlearning can be used as a tool to harness non-expert data to enhance the\nperformance of imitation learning policies. We show that while standard offline\nRL approaches can be ineffective at actually leveraging non-expert data under\nthe sparse data coverage settings typically encountered in the real world,\nsimple algorithmic modifications can allow for the utilization of this data,\nwithout significant additional assumptions. Our approach shows that broadening\nthe support of the policy distribution can allow imitation algorithms augmented\nby offline RL to solve tasks robustly, showing considerably enhanced recovery\nand generalization behavior. In manipulation tasks, these innovations\nsignificantly increase the range of initial conditions where learned policies\nare successful when non-expert data is incorporated. Moreover, we show that\nthese methods are able to leverage all collected data, including partial or\nsuboptimal demonstrations, to bolster task-directed policy performance. This\nunderscores the importance of algorithmic techniques for using non-expert data\nfor robust policy learning in robotics.",

In this paper, we introduce\n\\textbf{INPO}, an \\textbf{I}nfluence-aware \\textbf{N}egative\n\\textbf{P}reference \\textbf{O}ptimization framework that focuses on slowing the\ndivergence speed and improving the robustness of the model utility to the\nunlearning process.

We design an influence-aware message function\nto amplify the influence of unlearned edges and mitigate the tight topological\ncoupling between the forget set and the retain set. The influence of each edge\nis quickly estimated by a removal-based method.

We argue that CoT monitoring might support both control and\ntrustworthiness safety cases. We propose a two-part safety case: (1)\nestablishing that models lack dangerous capabilities when operating without\ntheir CoT, and (2) ensuring that any dangerous capabilities enabled by a CoT\nare detectable by CoT monitoring. We systematically examine two threats to\nmonitorability: neuralese and encoded reasoning, which we categorize into three\nforms (linguistic drift, steganography, and alien reasoning) and analyze their\npotential drivers. We evaluate existing and novel techniques for maintaining\nCoT faithfulness. For cases where models produce non-monitorable reasoning, we\nexplore the possibility of extracting a monitorable CoT from a non-monitorable\nCoT.

      "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a popular architecture for scaling large\nmodels. However, the rapidly growing scale outpaces model training on a single\nDC, driving a shift toward a more flexible, cross-DC training paradigm. Under\nthis, Expert Parallelism (EP) of MoE faces significant scalability issues due\nto the limited cross-DC bandwidth. Specifically, existing EP optimizations\nattempt to overlap data communication and computation, which has little benefit\nin low-bandwidth scenarios due to a much longer data communication time.\nTherefore, the trends of cross-DC EP scaling is fast becoming a critical\nroadblock to the continued growth of MoE models.\n  To address this, we propose HybridEP, a modeling-guided framework to optimize\nEP under constrained bandwidth. Our key idea is to dynamically transform the\nspatial placement of experts to reduce data communication traffic and\nfrequency, thereby minimizing EP's communication overheads. However, it is\nnon-trivial to find the optimal solution because it complicates the original\ncommunication pattern by mixing data and expert communication. We therefore\nbuild a stream-based model to determine the optimal transmission ratio. Guided\nby this, we incorporate two techniques: (1) domain-based partition to construct\nthe mapping between hybrid patterns and specific communication topology at GPU\nlevel, and (2) parameter-efficient migration to further refine this topology by\nreducing expert transmission overhead and enlarging the domain size. Combining\nall these designs, HybridEP can be considered as a more general EP with better\nscalability. Experimental results show that HybridEP outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art MoE training systems by up to 5.6x under constrained\nbandwidth. We further compare HybridEP and EP on large-scale simulations.\nHybridEP achieves up to 1.45x speedup with 1k DCs under different bandwidths.",

At its core is a canonical $ \\varepsilon $-quotient endowed with a\nuniversal property: among all $ \\varepsilon $-abstractions, it is the most\ninformative one that respects a prescribed bound on value loss. This\nconstruction induces an adjunction between abstraction and realization functors\n$ (Q_{\\varepsilon} \\dashv R_{\\varepsilon}) $, established via the Special\nAdjoint Functor Theorem, revealing a categorical duality between metric\nstructure and logical semantics. A behavioral pseudometric is characterized as\nthe unique fixed point of a Bellman-style operator, with contraction and\nLipschitz properties proved in a coalgebraic setting. A quantitative modal $\n\\mu $-calculus is introduced and shown to be expressively complete for\nlogically representable systems, so that behavioral distance coincides with\nmaximal logical deviation. Compositionality under interface refinement is\nanalyzed, clarifying how abstractions interact across system boundaries. An\nexact validation suite on finite Markov decision processes corroborates the\ncontraction property, value-loss bounds, stability under perturbation,\nadversarial distinguishability, and scalability, demonstrating both robustness\nand computational feasibility.
