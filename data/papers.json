      "abstract": "Scalable sampling of molecular states in thermodynamic equilibrium is a\nlong-standing challenge in statistical physics. Boltzmann generators tackle\nthis problem by pairing powerful normalizing flows with importance sampling to\nobtain statistically independent samples under the target distribution. In this\npaper, we extend the Boltzmann generator framework and introduce Sequential\nBoltzmann generators (SBG) with two key improvements. The first is a highly\nefficient non-equivariant Transformer-based normalizing flow operating directly\non all-atom Cartesian coordinates. In contrast to equivariant continuous flows\nof prior methods, we leverage exactly invertible non-equivariant architectures\nwhich are highly efficient both during sample generation and likelihood\ncomputation. As a result, this unlocks more sophisticated inference strategies\nbeyond standard importance sampling. More precisely, as a second key\nimprovement we perform inference-time scaling of flow samples using annealed\nLangevin dynamics which transports samples toward the target distribution\nleading to lower variance (annealed) importance weights which enable higher\nfidelity resampling with sequential Monte Carlo. SBG achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance w.r.t. all metrics on molecular systems, demonstrating the first\nequilibrium sampling in Cartesian coordinates of tri, tetra, and hexapeptides\nthat were so far intractable for prior Boltzmann generators.",

However, these capabilities are often emergent in larger models.\nThis means smaller models that can be run locally are less helpful and capable\nwith respect to certain reasoning tasks. To meet our problem space\nrequirements, we fine-tune smaller LLMs to disaster domains, as these domains\ninvolve complex and low-frequency physical common sense knowledge. We introduce\na pipeline to create Field Ready Instruction Decoding Agent (FRIDA) models,\nwhere domain experts and linguists combine their knowledge to make high-quality\nseed data that is used to generate synthetic data for fine-tuning. We create a\nset of 130 seed instructions for synthetic generation, a synthetic dataset of\n25000 instructions, and 119 evaluation instructions relating to both general\nand earthquake-specific object affordances. We fine-tune several LLaMa and\nMistral instruction-tuned models and find that FRIDA models outperform their\nbase models at a variety of sizes. We then run an ablation study to understand\nwhich kinds of synthetic data most affect performance and find that training\nphysical state and object function common sense knowledge alone improves over\nFRIDA models trained on all data. We conclude that the FRIDA pipeline is\ncapable of instilling general common sense, but needs to be augmented with\ninformation retrieval for specific domain knowledge.",

      "abstract": "The recent DeepSeek-R1 release has demonstrated the immense potential of\nreinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing the general reasoning capabilities of\nlarge language models (LLMs). While DeepSeek-R1 and other follow-up work\nprimarily focus on applying RL to competitive coding and math problems, this\npaper introduces SWE-RL, the first approach to scale RL-based LLM reasoning for\nreal-world software engineering. Leveraging a lightweight rule-based reward\n(e.g., the similarity score between ground-truth and LLM-generated solutions),\nSWE-RL enables LLMs to autonomously recover a developer's reasoning processes\nand solutions by learning from extensive open-source software evolution data --\nthe record of a software's entire lifecycle, including its code snapshots, code\nchanges, and events such as issues and pull requests. Trained on top of Llama\n3, our resulting reasoning model, Llama3-SWE-RL-70B, achieves a 41.0% solve\nrate on SWE-bench Verified -- a human-verified collection of real-world GitHub\nissues. To our knowledge, this is the best performance reported for\nmedium-sized (<100B) LLMs to date, even comparable to leading proprietary LLMs\nlike GPT-4o. Surprisingly, despite performing RL solely on software evolution\ndata, Llama3-SWE-RL has even emerged with generalized reasoning skills. For\nexample, it shows improved results on five out-of-domain tasks, namely,\nfunction coding, library use, code reasoning, mathematics, and general language\nunderstanding, whereas a supervised-finetuning baseline even leads to\nperformance degradation on average. Overall, SWE-RL opens up a new direction to\nimprove the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through reinforcement learning on\nmassive software engineering data.",

Although LLMs excel at parsing unambiguous utterances, they show\nstrong biases for ambiguous ones, typically predicting only preferred\ninterpretations. We constructively exploit this bias to generate an initial set\nof preferred disambiguations and then apply a specialized infilling model to\nidentify and generate missing interpretations.

However, most\nprevious studies focus on prompting the out-of-the-box LLMs, relying on their\ninnate capability for collaboration, which may not improve LLMs' performance as\nshown recently. In this paper, we introduce a new post-training paradigm MAPoRL\n(Multi-Agent Post-co-training for collaborative LLMs with Reinforcement\nLearning), to explicitly elicit the collaborative behaviors and further unleash\nthe power of multi-agentic LLM frameworks. In MAPoRL, multiple LLMs first\ngenerate their own responses independently and engage in a multi-turn\ndiscussion to collaboratively improve the final answer. In the end, a MAPoRL\nverifier evaluates both the answer and the discussion, by assigning a score\nthat verifies the correctness of the answer, while adding incentives to\nencourage corrective and persuasive discussions. The score serves as the\nco-training reward, and is then maximized through multi-agent RL. Unlike\nexisting LLM post-training paradigms, MAPoRL advocates the co-training of\nmultiple LLMs together using RL for better generalization. Accompanied by\nanalytical insights, our experiments demonstrate that training individual LLMs\nalone is insufficient to induce effective collaboration. In contrast,\nmulti-agent co-training can boost the collaboration performance across\nbenchmarks, with generalization to unseen domains.",

A key feature of EgoSim is its use of real motion\ncapture data to render motion artifacts, which are especially noticeable with\narm- or leg-worn cameras. In addition, we introduce MultiEgoView, a dataset of\negocentric footage from six body-worn cameras and ground-truth full-body 3D\nposes during several activities: 119 hours of data are derived from AMASS\nmotion sequences in four high-fidelity virtual environments, which we augment\nwith 5 hours of real-world motion data from 13 participants using six GoPro\ncameras and 3D body pose references from an Xsens motion capture suit.\n  We demonstrate EgoSim's effectiveness by training an end-to-end video-only 3D\npose estimation network.

Despite\nthe possibility of using the IoT in irrigation control systems, there are\ncomplexities in designing such systems. Considering this issue, it is possible\nto use agent-oriented software engineering (AOSE) methodologies to design\ncomplex cyber-physical systems such as IoT-based systems. In this research, a\nsmart irrigation system is designed based on Prometheus AOSE methodology, to\nreduce water loss by maintaining soil moisture in a suitable interval. The\ndesigned system comprises sensors, a central agent, and irrigation nodes. These\nagents follow defined rules to maintain soil moisture at a desired level\ncooperatively. For system simulation, a hybrid agent-based and system dynamics\nmodel was designed. In this hybrid model, soil moisture dynamics were modeled\nbased on the system dynamics approach.

It examines the\noutcomes of different design choices through a new layout-aware IE test suite,\nbenchmarking against the state-of-art (SoA) model LayoutLMv3. The results show\nthat the configuration from one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) trial achieves\nnear-optimal results with 14.1 points F1-score gain from the baseline model,\nwhile full factorial exploration yields only a slightly higher 15.1 points gain\nat around 36x greater token usage. We demonstrate that well-configured\ngeneral-purpose LLMs can match the performance of specialized models, providing\na cost-effective alternative.

We ground our work on CLIP, a vision-language pre-trained encoder\nmodel that can perform zero-shot classification by matching an image with text\nprompts ``a photo of a <class-name>.''. Purification is the path we choose\nsince it does not require adversarial training on specific attack types and\nthus can cope with any foreseen attacks. We then formulate purification risk as\nthe KL divergence between the joint distributions of the purification process\nof denoising the adversarial samples and the attack process of adding\nperturbations to benign samples, through bidirectional Stochastic Differential\nEquations (SDEs). The final derived results inspire us to explore purification\nin the multi-modal latent space of CLIP. We propose two variants for our\nCLIPure approach: CLIPure-Diff which models the likelihood of images' latent\nvectors with the DiffusionPrior module in DaLLE-2 (modeling the generation\nprocess of CLIP's latent vectors), and CLIPure-Cos which models the likelihood\nwith the cosine similarity between the embeddings of an image and ``a photo of\na.''. As far as we know, CLIPure is the first purification method in\nmulti-modal latent space and CLIPure-Cos is the first purification method that\nis not based on generative models, which substantially improves defense\nefficiency. We conducted extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and 13\ndatasets that previous CLIP-based defense methods used for evaluating zero-shot\nclassification robustness. Results show that CLIPure boosts the SOTA robustness\nby a large margin, e.g., from 71.7% to 91.1% on CIFAR10, from 59.6% to 72.6% on\nImageNet, and 108% relative improvements of average robustness on the 13\ndatasets over previous SOTA.

The extent to which SAEs can help us understand\ncomputations is unclear because they are not designed to \"sparsify\"\ncomputations in any sense, only latent activations. To solve this, we propose\nJacobian SAEs (JSAEs), which yield not only sparsity in the input and output\nactivations of a given model component but also sparsity in the computation\n(formally, the Jacobian) connecting them. With a na\\\"ive implementation, the\nJacobians in LLMs would be computationally intractable due to their size. One\nkey technical contribution is thus finding an efficient way of computing\nJacobians in this setup. We find that JSAEs extract a relatively large degree\nof computational sparsity while preserving downstream LLM performance\napproximately as well as traditional SAEs. We also show that Jacobians are a\nreasonable proxy for computational sparsity because MLPs are approximately\nlinear when rewritten in the JSAE basis. Lastly, we show that JSAEs achieve a\ngreater degree of computational sparsity on pre-trained LLMs than on the\nequivalent randomized LLM.

      "abstract": "Multi-robot task planning and collaboration are critical challenges in\nrobotics. While Behavior Trees (BTs) have been established as a popular control\narchitecture and are plannable for a single robot, the development of effective\nmulti-robot BT planning algorithms remains challenging due to the complexity of\ncoordinating diverse action spaces. We propose the Multi-Robot Behavior Tree\nPlanning (MRBTP) algorithm, with theoretical guarantees of both soundness and\ncompleteness. MRBTP features cross-tree expansion to coordinate heterogeneous\nactions across different BTs to achieve the team's goal. For homogeneous\nactions, we retain backup structures among BTs to ensure robustness and prevent\nredundant execution through intention sharing. While MRBTP is capable of\ngenerating BTs for both homogeneous and heterogeneous robot teams, its\nefficiency can be further improved. We then propose an optional plugin for\nMRBTP when Large Language Models (LLMs) are available to reason goal-related\nactions for each robot. These relevant actions can be pre-planned to form\nlong-horizon subtrees, significantly enhancing the planning speed and\ncollaboration efficiency of MRBTP. We evaluate our algorithm in warehouse\nmanagement and everyday service scenarios. Results demonstrate MRBTP's\nrobustness and execution efficiency under varying settings, as well as the\nability of the pre-trained LLM to generate effective task-specific subtrees for\nMRBTP.",

      "abstract": "Low-cost accelerometers play a crucial role in modern society due to their\nadvantages of small size, ease of integration, wearability, and mass\nproduction, making them widely applicable in automotive systems, aerospace, and\nwearable technology. However, this widely used sensor suffers from severe\naccuracy and range limitations. To this end, we propose a honed-energy\nregularized and optimal supervised GAN (HEROS-GAN), which transforms low-cost\nsensor signals into high-cost equivalents, thereby overcoming the precision and\nrange limitations of low-cost accelerometers. Due to the lack of frame-level\npaired low-cost and high-cost signals for training, we propose an Optimal\nTransport Supervision (OTS), which leverages optimal transport theory to\nexplore potential consistency between unpaired data, thereby maximizing\nsupervisory information. Moreover, we propose a Modulated Laplace Energy (MLE),\nwhich injects appropriate energy into the generator to encourage it to break\nrange limitations, enhance local changes, and enrich signal details. Given the\nabsence of a dedicated dataset, we specifically establish a Low-cost\nAccelerometer Signal Enhancement Dataset (LASED) containing tens of thousands\nof samples, which is the first dataset serving to improve the accuracy and\nrange of accelerometers and is released in Github. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that a GAN combined with either OTS or MLE alone can surpass the\nprevious signal enhancement SOTA methods by an order of magnitude. Integrating\nboth OTS and MLE, the HEROS-GAN achieves remarkable results, which doubles the\naccelerometer range while reducing signal noise by two orders of magnitude,\nestablishing a benchmark in the accelerometer signal processing.",

      "abstract": "The debate around bias in AI systems is central to discussions on algorithmic\nfairness.

In this paper, we challenge this assumption and argue that a\nprecise conceptualization of bias is necessary to effectively address fairness\nconcerns. Rather than viewing bias as inherently negative or unfair, we\nhighlight the importance of distinguishing between bias and discrimination.

      "abstract": "Human drivers adeptly navigate complex scenarios by utilizing rich\nattentional semantics, but the current autonomous systems struggle to replicate\nthis ability, as they often lose critical semantic information when converting\n2D observations into 3D space. In this sense, it hinders their effective\ndeployment in dynamic and complex environments. Leveraging the superior scene\nunderstanding and reasoning abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we\npropose VLM-E2E, a novel framework that uses the VLMs to enhance training by\nproviding attentional cues. Our method integrates textual representations into\nBird's-Eye-View (BEV) features for semantic supervision, which enables the\nmodel to learn richer feature representations that explicitly capture the\ndriver's attentional semantics. By focusing on attentional semantics, VLM-E2E\nbetter aligns with human-like driving behavior, which is critical for\nnavigating dynamic and complex environments. Furthermore, we introduce a\nBEV-Text learnable weighted fusion strategy to address the issue of modality\nimportance imbalance in fusing multimodal information. This approach\ndynamically balances the contributions of BEV and text features, ensuring that\nthe complementary information from visual and textual modality is effectively\nutilized. By explicitly addressing the imbalance in multimodal fusion, our\nmethod facilitates a more holistic and robust representation of driving\nenvironments.

      "abstract": "Popularity prediction in information cascades plays a crucial role in social\ncomputing, with broad applications in viral marketing, misinformation control,\nand content recommendation. However, information propagation mechanisms, user\nbehavior, and temporal activity patterns exhibit significant diversity,\nnecessitating a foundational model capable of adapting to such variations. At\nthe same time, the amount of available cascade data remains relatively limited\ncompared to the vast datasets used for training large language models (LLMs).\nRecent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of leveraging LLMs for\ntime-series prediction by exploiting commonalities across different time-series\ndomains. Building on this insight, we introduce the Autoregressive Information\nCascade Predictor (AutoCas), an LLM-enhanced model designed specifically for\ncascade popularity prediction. Unlike natural language sequences, cascade data\nis characterized by complex local topologies, diffusion contexts, and evolving\ndynamics, requiring specialized adaptations for effective LLM integration. To\naddress these challenges, we first tokenize cascade data to align it with\nsequence modeling principles. Next, we reformulate cascade diffusion as an\nautoregressive modeling task to fully harness the architectural strengths of\nLLMs. Beyond conventional approaches, we further introduce prompt learning to\nenhance the synergy between LLMs and cascade prediction. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that AutoCas significantly outperforms baseline models in cascade\npopularity prediction while exhibiting scaling behavior inherited from LLMs.\nCode is available at this repository:\nhttps://anonymous.4open.science/r/AutoCas-85C6",

Technically, ExPath comprises three\ncomponents: (1) a large protein language model (pLM) that encodes and embeds\nAA-seqs into graph, overcoming traditional obstacles in processing AA-seq data,\nsuch as BLAST; (2) PathMamba, a hybrid architecture combining graph neural\nnetworks (GNNs) with state-space sequence modeling (Mamba) to capture both\nlocal interactions and global pathway-level dependencies; and (3)\nPathExplainer, a subgraph learning module that identifies functionally critical\nnodes and edges through trainable pathway masks.
