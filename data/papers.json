      "abstract": "Answer verification is crucial not only for evaluating large language models\n(LLMs) by matching their unstructured outputs against standard answers, but\nalso serves as the reward model to guide LLM optimization. Most evaluation\nframeworks rely on regularized matching or employ general LLMs for answer\nverification, which demands extensive, repetitive customization for regex rules\nor evaluation prompts. Two fundamental limitations persist in current\nmethodologies: 1) the absence of comprehensive benchmarks that systematically\nevaluate verification capabilities across different LLMs; and 2) the nascent\nstage of verifier development, where existing approaches lack both the\nrobustness to handle complex edge cases and the generalizability across\ndifferent domains. In this work, we develop CompassVerifier, an accurate and\nrobust lightweight verifier model for evaluation and outcome reward. It\ndemonstrates multi-domain competency spanning math, knowledge, and diverse\nreasoning tasks, with the capability to process various answer types, including\nmulti-subproblems, formulas, and sequence answers, while effectively\nidentifying abnormal/invalid responses. We introduce VerifierBench benchmark\ncomprising model outputs collected from multiple data sources, augmented\nthrough manual analysis of metaerror patterns to enhance CompassVerifier. We\nanticipate that CompassVerifier and VerifierBench will facilitate answer\nverification, evaluation protocols, and reinforcement learning research.

      "abstract": "Can large language models improve without external data -- by generating\ntheir own questions and answers? We hypothesize that a pre-trained language\nmodel can improve its reasoning skills given only a single prompt specifying\nthe topic (e.g., algebra word problems) and asking the model to generate its\nown questions. To do this, we propose Self-Questioning Language Models (SQLM):\nan asymmetric self-play framework where a proposer is given the topic and\ngenerates a question for a solver, who tries to answer it. Both the proposer\nand solver are trained via reinforcement learning. The proposer receives a\nreward if the problem is not too easy or too difficult, and the solver receives\na reward based on majority voting, a proxy for correctness in the absence of\nground-truth answers. For coding, the proposer can instead generate unit tests\nwhich are used for verification. We study this asymmetric self-play framework\non three benchmarks: three-digit multiplication, algebra problems from the\nOMEGA benchmark, and programming problems from Codeforces. By continually\ngenerating more interesting problems and attempting to solve them, language\nmodels can improve on downstream benchmarks without access to any curated\ntraining datasets.",

By formulating agent execution as\nMarkov decision process, we define an unified data interface and propose a\nhierarchical RL algorithm, LightningRL, which contains a credit assignment\nmodule, allowing us to decompose trajectories generated by ANY agents into\ntraining transition. This enables RL to handle complex interaction logic, such\nas multi-agent scenarios and dynamic workflows. For the system design, we\nintroduce a Training-Agent Disaggregation architecture, and brings agent\nobservability frameworks into agent runtime, providing a standardized agent\nfinetuning interface.

By drawing on Kantian philosophy\nand related contemporary interpretations, freedom is developed as the\ncounterpart to the concept of responsibility. Two dimensions of freedom are\ndeveloped in further detail: freedom as capability and freedom as opportunity.\nThese two dimensions of freedom are then applied in a proto-framework that\nsystematically considers AI's impact on society using the Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals.

      "abstract": "Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific validation and of the\nauthority it confers on its results. Reproducibility in machine learning\nevaluations leads to greater trust, confidence, and value. However, the ground\ntruth responses used in machine learning often necessarily come from humans,\namong whom disagreement is prevalent, and surprisingly little research has\nstudied the impact of effectively ignoring disagreement in these responses, as\nis typically the case. One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for\ncollecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more\nsamples from multiple annotators for each example greatly increases the\nper-item annotation costs. We investigate the trade-off between the number of\nitems ($N$) and the number of responses per item ($K$) needed for reliable\nmachine learning evaluation. We analyze a diverse collection of categorical\ndatasets for which multiple annotations per item exist, and simulated\ndistributions fit to these datasets, to determine the optimal $(N, K)$\nconfiguration, given a fixed budget ($N \\times K$), for collecting evaluation\ndata and reliably comparing the performance of machine learning models. Our\nfindings show, first, that accounting for human disagreement may come with $N\n\\times K$ at no more than 1000 (and often much lower) for every dataset tested\non at least one metric. Moreover, this minimal $N \\times K$ almost always\noccurred for $K > 10$. Furthermore, the nature of the tradeoff between $K$ and\n$N$ -- or if one even existed -- depends on the evaluation metric, with metrics\nthat are more sensitive to the full distribution of responses performing better\nat higher levels of $K$. Our methods can be used to help ML practitioners get\nmore effective test data by finding the optimal metrics and number of items and\nannotations per item to collect to get the most reliability for their budget.",

Unlike popular model serving systems that rely on monolithic\nand heuristic task schedulers, Block operates as a fully distributed,\nstateless, and predictive scheduling system to achieve low overhead,\nreliability, and scalability. It leverages the deterministic and predictable\ncharacteristics of LLM inferences, such as host configurations, response\nlengths, and hardware performance, to make scheduling decisions based on\naccurately predicted metrics. Evaluation on a 12 GPUs cluster shows that Block\nsignificantly outperforms heuristic schedulers, boosting serving capacity by up\nto 16.7\\% and reducing P99 tail latency by up to 49.5\\%. These performance\ngains remain consistent across diverse models, workloads and configurations.\nCode and data are open-sourced.",

In light of this, we aim to bridge\nthis unexplored gap, advancing the novel metalens endoscopy. First, we\nestablish datasets for metalens endoscopy and conduct preliminary optical\nsimulation, identifying two derived optical issues that physically adhere to\nstrong optical priors. Second, we propose MetaScope, a novel optics-driven\nneural network tailored for metalens endoscopy driven by physical optics.\nMetaScope comprises two novel designs: Optics-informed Intensity Adjustment\n(OIA), rectifying intensity decay by learning optical embeddings, and\nOptics-informed Chromatic Correction (OCC), mitigating chromatic aberration by\nlearning spatial deformations informed by learned Point Spread Function (PSF)\ndistributions. To enhance joint learning, we further deploy a gradient-guided\ndistillation to transfer knowledge from the foundational model adaptively.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that MetaScope not only outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in both metalens segmentation and restoration but also\nachieves impressive generalized ability in real biomedical scenes.",

These models also require extensive, high-quality datasets for\ntraining. To address these limitations, we propose EmoSteer-TTS, a novel\ntraining-free approach, to achieve fine-grained speech emotion control\n(conversion, interpolation, erasure) by activation steering. We first\nempirically observe that modifying a subset of the internal activations within\na flow matching-based TTS model can effectively alter the emotional tone of\nsynthesized speech. Building on this insight, we then develop a training-free\nand efficient algorithm, including activation extraction, emotional token\nsearching, and inference-time steering, which can be seamlessly integrated into\na wide range of pretrained models (e.g., F5-TTS, CosyVoice2, and E2-TTS). In\naddition, to derive effective steering vectors, we construct a curated\nemotional speech dataset with diverse speakers. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that EmoSteer-TTS enables fine-grained, interpretable, and\ncontinuous control over speech emotion, outperforming the state-of-the-art\n(SOTA).

This work introduces EDCIM (Error Detection and Correction for\nInterpretable Mathematics), a method for detecting and correcting these errors\nin interpretable mathematics tasks, where the model must generate the exact\nfunctional form that explicitly solve the problem (expressed in natural\nlanguage) rather than a black-box solution. EDCIM uses LLMs to generate a\nsystem of equations for a given problem, followed by a symbolic error-detection\nframework that identifies errors and provides targeted feedback for LLM-based\ncorrection. To optimize efficiency, EDCIM integrates lightweight, open-source\nLLMs with more powerful proprietary models, balancing cost and accuracy. This\nbalance is controlled by a single hyperparameter, allowing users to control the\ntrade-off based on their cost and accuracy requirements.

      "abstract": "While prior research on text-to-image generation has predominantly focused on\nbiases in human depictions, we investigate a more subtle yet pervasive\nphenomenon: demographic bias in generated objects (e.g., cars). We introduce\nSODA (Stereotyped Object Diagnostic Audit), a novel framework for\nsystematically measuring such biases. Our approach compares visual attributes\nof objects generated with demographic cues (e.g., \"for young people'') to those\nfrom neutral prompts, across 2,700 images produced by three state-of-the-art\nmodels (GPT Image-1, Imagen 4, and Stable Diffusion) in five object categories.\nThrough a comprehensive analysis, we uncover strong associations between\nspecific demographic groups and visual attributes, such as recurring color\npatterns prompted by gender or ethnicity cues. These patterns reflect and\nreinforce not only well-known stereotypes but also more subtle and unintuitive\nbiases. We also observe that some models generate less diverse outputs, which\nin turn amplifies the visual disparities compared to neutral prompts. Our\nproposed auditing framework offers a practical approach for testing, revealing\nhow stereotypes still remain embedded in today's generative models. We see this\nas an essential step toward more systematic and responsible AI development.",

However, there is a risk that malicious individuals might misuse these\ncapabilities for misleading activities. Although existing research has\nattempted to shield photographic images from being manipulated by generative\nmodels, there remains a significant disparity in the protection offered to\nvideo content editing. To bridge the gap, we propose a protection method named\nVideoGuard, which can effectively protect videos from unauthorized malicious\nediting. This protection is achieved through the subtle introduction of nearly\nunnoticeable perturbations that interfere with the functioning of the intended\ngenerative diffusion models. Due to the redundancy between video frames, and\ninter-frame attention mechanism in video diffusion models, simply applying\nimage-based protection methods separately to every video frame can not shield\nvideo from unauthorized editing. To tackle the above challenge, we adopt joint\nframe optimization, treating all video frames as an optimization entity.\nFurthermore, we extract video motion information and fuse it into optimization\nobjectives. Thus, these alterations can effectively force the models to produce\noutputs that are implausible and inconsistent. We provide a pipeline to\noptimize this perturbation. Finally, we use both objective metrics and\nsubjective metrics to demonstrate the efficacy of our method, and the results\nshow that the protection performance of VideoGuard is superior to all the\nbaseline methods.",

This paper introduces a minimal formalism for belief systems\nas directed, weighted graphs. In this framework, nodes represent individual\nbeliefs, edges encode epistemic relationships (e.g., support or contradiction),\nand two distinct functions assign each belief a credibility (reflecting source\ntrust) and a confidence (derived from internal structural support). Unlike\nclassical probabilistic models, our approach does not assume prior coherence or\nrequire belief updating.

The model is purely static and\ndeliberately excludes inference or revision procedures. Its aim is to provide a\nfoundational substrate for analyzing the internal organization of belief\nsystems, including coherence conditions, epistemic tensions, and\nrepresentational limits.

Recent advancements aim to address\nthis limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft,\nabstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space.\nThis paper explores the `Soft Thinking' capabilities of various LLMs by\nexamining the models' internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques.\nContrary to the common belief that Soft Thinking enables the simultaneous\nexploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs\npredominantly rely on the most influential component of the soft inputs during\nsubsequent decoding steps. This reliance hinders the exploration of different\nreasoning paths and reduces vanilla Soft Thinking to a form of greedy decoding,\nobscuring the advantage of transmitting more information through Soft Tokens.\nTo tackle this issue, we explore sampling strategies to introduce\n\\emph{randomness}, employing methods such as Dirichlet resampling and the\nGumbel-Softmax trick.

The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing\nnatural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original\npropositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity\nfor generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated\nsentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context\nvariable.

      "abstract": "In real-world routing problems, users often propose conflicting or\nunreasonable requirements, which result in infeasible optimization models due\nto overly restrictive or contradictory constraints, leading to an empty\nfeasible solution set. Existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods\nattempt to diagnose infeasible models, but modifying such models often involves\nmultiple potential adjustments that these methods do not consider. To fill this\ngap, we introduce Multi-Objective Infeasibility Diagnosis (MOID), which\ncombines LLM agents and multi-objective optimization within an automatic\nrouting solver, to provide a set of representative actionable suggestions.\nSpecifically, MOID employs multi-objective optimization to consider both path\ncost and constraint violation, generating a set of trade-off solutions, each\nencompassing varying degrees of model adjustments. To extract practical\ninsights from these solutions, MOID utilizes LLM agents to generate a solution\nanalysis function for the infeasible model. This function analyzes these\ndistinct solutions to diagnose the original infeasible model, providing users\nwith diverse diagnostic insights and suggestions. Finally, we compare MOID with\nseveral LLM-based methods on 50 types of infeasible routing problems. The\nresults indicate that MOID automatically generates multiple diagnostic\nsuggestions in a single run, providing more practical insights for restoring\nmodel feasibility and decision-making compared to existing methods.",

It comprises four distinct small-scale agents, i.e.,\nplanning, execution, judgment, and answer agents, with clearly defined roles\nand effective collaboration. Notably, the judgment agent exclusively verifies\ncorrectness and redirects to prior agents for revisions, outperforming\nconventional correction strategies. To further expand the capability boundaries\nof the framework, we propose mixed reward modeling that balances agent-specific\nabilities and global collaboration, as well as agent-wise hybrid test-time\nscaling, which customizes different scaling strategies for each agent based on\ntheir functions. Evaluated on benchmarks spanning both document-based and\nnon-document-based settings, our MACT shows superior performance with a smaller\nparameter scale without sacrificing the ability of general and mathematical\ntasks. Especially, it stands out in benchmarks involving long visual contexts\nand complicated reasoning. The three variants of MACT consistently hold the top\nthree positions in average scores, leading in 13 of the 15 benchmarks. Code\nwill be available at: https://github.com/YU-deep/MACT.git.",

Existing methods propose separation through generative or\ndiscriminative objectives, but they still face the inherent ambiguity of\ndisentangling intertwined concepts. Instead, we ask: Can we bypass explicit\ndisentanglement by learning to merge style and content invertibly, allowing\nseparation to emerge naturally? We propose SCFlow, a flow-matching framework\nthat learns bidirectional mappings between entangled and disentangled\nrepresentations. Our approach is built upon three key insights: 1) Training\nsolely to merge style and content, a well-defined task, enables invertible\ndisentanglement without explicit supervision; 2) flow matching bridges on\narbitrary distributions, avoiding the restrictive Gaussian priors of diffusion\nmodels and normalizing flows; and 3) a synthetic dataset of 510,000 samples (51\nstyles $\\times$ 10,000 content samples) was curated to simulate disentanglement\nthrough systematic style-content pairing. Beyond controllable generation tasks,\nwe demonstrate that SCFlow generalizes to ImageNet-1k and WikiArt in zero-shot\nsettings and achieves competitive performance, highlighting that\ndisentanglement naturally emerges from the invertible merging process.",

To overcome this,\nwe propose Hide and Seek Game (HSG), a dynamic adversarial framework for error\ngeneration and diagnosis, and evaluate it on mathematical problem-solving. HSG\ninvolves two adversarial roles: Sneaky, which \"hides\" by generating subtle,\ndeceptive reasoning errors, and Diagnosis, which \"seeks\" to accurately detect\nthem. Through adversarial co-evolution, both error stealth and diagnostic\nprecision are enhanced. Experiments on several math reasoning tasks show that\nHSG significantly boosts error diagnosis, achieving 16.8\\%--31.4\\% higher\naccuracy than baselines like GPT-4o.

First, we introduce an enhanced Unified\nModeling Language (UML) sequence diagram tailored for service-oriented\narchitectures.

Second, recognizing the critical role of data\nflow, we introduce a dedicated data dependency inference (DDI) task. DDI\nsystematically constructs an explicit data dependency graph prior to actual\ncode synthesis. To ensure reliability, we formalize DDI as a constrained\nmathematical reasoning task through novel prompting strategies, aligning with\nLLMs' excellent mathematical strengths. Additional static parsing and\ndependency pruning further reduce context complexity and cognitive load\nassociated with intricate specifications, thereby enhancing reasoning accuracy\nand efficiency.",

      "abstract": "General logical reasoning, defined as the ability to reason deductively on\ndomain-agnostic tasks, continues to be a challenge for large language models\n(LLMs). Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not\ninterpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in\nneurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We\nfirst identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical\nreasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic\nreasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach\ncomprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network,\nperforms symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on\ndomain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on\ndomain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there\nhas not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the\nfollowing question: Which approach is more promising for developing general\nlogical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class\ndomain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses\nthe integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the\nhybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each\napproach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising\nfor developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is\nmore interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of\nexisting LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a\ngeneralizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design,\nmodel-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.",
