      "abstract": "The capacity for complex mathematical reasoning is a key benchmark for\nartificial intelligence. While reinforcement learning (RL) applied to LLMs\nshows promise, progress is significantly hindered by the lack of large-scale\ntraining data that is sufficiently challenging, possesses verifiable answer\nformats suitable for RL, and is free from contamination with evaluation\nbenchmarks. To address these limitations, we introduce DeepMath-103K, a new,\nlarge-scale dataset comprising approximately 103K mathematical problems,\nspecifically designed to train advanced reasoning models via RL. DeepMath-103K\nis curated through a rigorous pipeline involving source analysis, stringent\ndecontamination against numerous benchmarks, and filtering for high difficulty\n(primarily Levels 5-9), significantly exceeding existing open resources in\nchallenge. Each problem includes a verifiable final answer, enabling rule-based\nRL, and three distinct R1-generated solutions suitable for diverse training\nparadigms like supervised fine-tuning or distillation. Spanning a wide range of\nmathematical topics, DeepMath-103K promotes the development of generalizable\nreasoning. We demonstrate that models trained on DeepMath-103K achieve\nsignificant improvements on challenging mathematical benchmarks, validating its\neffectiveness. We release DeepMath-103K publicly to facilitate community\nprogress in building more capable AI reasoning systems:\nhttps://github.com/zwhe99/DeepMath.",

However, the reliance on tokenizing 3D structures into\ndiscrete tokens causes substantial loss of fidelity about fine-grained\nstructural details and correlations. In this paper, we systematically elucidate\nthe design space of multimodal PLMs to overcome their limitations. We identify\ntokenization loss and inaccurate structure token predictions by the PLMs as\nmajor bottlenecks. To address these, our proposed design space covers improved\ngenerative modeling, structure-aware architectures and representation learning,\nand data exploration. Our advancements approach finer-grained supervision,\ndemonstrating that token-based multimodal PLMs can achieve robust structural\nmodeling. The effective design methods dramatically improve the structure\ngeneration diversity, and notably, folding abilities of our 650M model by\nreducing the RMSD from 5.52 to 2.36 on PDB testset, even outperforming 3B\nbaselines and on par with the specialized folding models.",

In this context, the best performing individual\nalgorithms are often hand-crafted hybrid heuristics which perform many restarts\nof fast local optimization approaches. However, data-driven techniques to\ncreate optimized restart schedules have not yet been extensively studied.\n  Here, we present a simple scheduling approach that iteratively selects the\nalgorithm performing best on the distribution of unsolved training problems at\ntime of selection, resulting in a problem-independent solver schedule.

Masculine\ndefaults involve three key parts: (i) the cultural context, (ii) the masculine\ncharacteristics or behaviors, and (iii) the reward for, or simply acceptance\nof, those masculine characteristics or behaviors. In this work, we study\ndiscourse-based masculine defaults, and propose a twofold framework for (i) the\nlarge-scale discovery and analysis of gendered discourse words in spoken\ncontent via our Gendered Discourse Correlation Framework (GDCF); and (ii) the\nmeasurement of the gender bias associated with these gendered discourse words\nin LLMs via our Discourse Word-Embedding Association Test (D-WEAT). We focus\nour study on podcasts, a popular and growing form of social media, analyzing\n15,117 podcast episodes. We analyze correlations between gender and discourse\nwords -- discovered via LDA and BERTopic -- to automatically form gendered\ndiscourse word lists. We then study the prevalence of these gendered discourse\nwords in domain-specific contexts, and find that gendered discourse-based\nmasculine defaults exist in the domains of business, technology/politics, and\nvideo games. Next, we study the representation of these gendered discourse\nwords from a state-of-the-art LLM embedding model from OpenAI, and find that\nthe masculine discourse words have a more stable and robust representation than\nthe feminine discourse words, which may result in better system performance on\ndownstream tasks for men.

      "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising solution to compress large\nlanguage models (LLMs) by transferring their knowledge to smaller models.\nDuring this process, white-box KD methods usually minimize the distance between\nthe output distributions of the teacher model and the student model to transfer\nmore information. However, we reveal that the current white-box KD framework\nexhibits two limitations: a) bridging probability distributions from different\noutput spaces will limit the similarity between the teacher model and the\nstudent model; b) this framework cannot be applied to LLMs with different\nvocabularies. One of the root causes for these limitations is that the\ndistributions from the teacher and the student for KD are output by different\nprediction heads, which yield distributions in different output spaces and\ndimensions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a dual-space knowledge\ndistillation (DSKD) framework that unifies the prediction heads of the teacher\nand the student models for KD. Specifically, we first introduce two projectors\nwith ideal initialization to project the teacher/student hidden states into the\nstudent/teacher representation spaces. After this, the hidden states from\ndifferent models can share the same head and unify the output spaces of the\ndistributions. Furthermore, we develop an exact token alignment (ETA) algorithm\nto align the same tokens in two differently-tokenized sequences. Based on the\nabove, our DSKD framework is a general KD framework that supports both\noff-policy and on-policy KD, and KD between any two LLMs regardless of their\nvocabularies. Extensive experiments on instruction-following, mathematical\nreasoning, and code generation benchmarks show that DSKD significantly\noutperforms existing methods based on the current white-box KD framework and\nsurpasses other cross-tokenizer KD methods for LLMs with different\nvocabularies.",

This training-inference divergences hinder the\nalignment between inference and training data distributions, due to potential\nprediction biases and cumulative error accumulation. To address this problem,\nwe propose an intuitive but effective fine-tuning framework, called Adversarial\nDiffusion Tuning (ADT), by stimulating the inference process during\noptimization and aligning the final outputs with training data by adversarial\nsupervision. Specifically, to achieve robust adversarial training, ADT features\na siamese-network discriminator with a fixed pre-trained backbone and\nlightweight trainable parameters, incorporates an image-to-image sampling\nstrategy to smooth discriminative difficulties, and preserves the original\ndiffusion loss to prevent discriminator hacking. In addition, we carefully\nconstrain the backward-flowing path for back-propagating gradients along the\ninference path without incurring memory overload or gradient explosion.\nFinally, extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion models (v1.5, XL, and v3),\ndemonstrate that ADT significantly improves both distribution alignment and\nimage quality.",

      "abstract": "Understanding how artificial systems can develop spatial awareness and\nreasoning has long been a challenge in AI research. Traditional models often\nrely on passive observation, but embodied cognition theory suggests that deeper\nunderstanding emerges from active interaction with the environment. This study\ninvestigates whether neural networks can autonomously internalize spatial\nconcepts through interaction, focusing on planar navigation tasks. Using Gated\nRecurrent Units (GRUs) combined with Meta-Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL), we\nshow that agents can learn to encode spatial properties like direction,\ndistance, and obstacle avoidance. We introduce Hybrid Dynamical Systems (HDS)\nto model the agent-environment interaction as a closed dynamical system,\nrevealing stable limit cycles that correspond to optimal navigation strategies.\nRidge Representation allows us to map navigation paths into a fixed-dimensional\nbehavioral space, enabling comparison with neural states. Canonical Correlation\nAnalysis (CCA) confirms strong alignment between these representations,\nsuggesting that the agent's neural states actively encode spatial knowledge.\nIntervention experiments further show that specific neural dimensions are\ncausally linked to navigation performance. This work provides an approach to\nbridging the gap between action and perception in AI, offering new insights\ninto building adaptive, interpretable models that can generalize across complex\nenvironments.

Combining modern and classical techniques offers a\npath to maintaining competitive performance while enabling practical\napplications. Feature Learning from Image Markers (FLIM) methodology empowers\nexperts to design convolutional encoders through user-drawn markers, with\nfilters learned directly from these annotations.

Existing TGN designs face a dilemma under these dual\nscenarios. Anonymous TGNs, which rely solely on temporal and structural\ninformation, offer strong inductive generalisation but struggle to distinguish\nknown nodes.

By integrating this trajectory-aware module with a\nstandard TGN using multi-head attention, TETGN effectively balances\ntransductive accuracy with inductive generalisation.

However, existing medical agent systems often rely\non static, manually crafted workflows that lack the flexibility to accommodate\ndiverse diagnostic requirements and adapt to emerging clinical scenarios.\nMotivated by the success of automated machine learning (AutoML), this paper\nintroduces a novel framework for the automated design of medical agent\narchitectures. Specifically, we define a hierarchical and expressive agent\nsearch space that enables dynamic workflow adaptation through structured\nmodifications at the node, structural, and framework levels. Our framework\nconceptualizes medical agents as graph-based architectures composed of diverse,\nfunctional node types and supports iterative self-improvement guided by\ndiagnostic feedback. Experimental results on skin disease diagnosis tasks\ndemonstrate that the proposed method effectively evolves workflow structures\nand significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy over time. This work represents\nthe first fully automated framework for medical agent architecture design and\noffers a scalable, adaptable foundation for deploying intelligent agents in\nreal-world clinical environments.",

In this paper, we focus on the\nmulti-task setting with single-input-multiple-outputs (SIMO) and show that it\nqualitatively differs from the single-input-single-output model merging\nsettings studied in the literature due to the existence of task-specific\ndecoders and diverse loss objectives.

Recently, Deep Reinforcement\nLearning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful tool to optimize resource allocation\npolicies in business processes. In the DRL framework, an agent learns a policy\nthrough interaction with the environment, guided solely by reward signals that\nindicate the quality of its decisions. However, existing algorithms are not\nsuitable for dynamic environments such as business processes. Furthermore,\nexisting DRL-based methods rely on engineered reward functions that approximate\nthe desired objective, but a misalignment between reward and objective can lead\nto undesired decisions or suboptimal policies. To address these issues, we\npropose a rollout-based DRL algorithm and a reward function to optimize the\nobjective directly. Our algorithm iteratively improves the policy by evaluating\nexecution trajectories following different actions. Our reward function\ndirectly decomposes the objective function of minimizing the mean cycle time.\nMaximizing our reward function guarantees that the objective function is\nminimized without requiring extensive reward engineering.

      "abstract": "Recent advances in reasoning-focused large language models (LLMs) mark a\nshift from general LLMs toward models designed for complex decision-making, a\ncrucial aspect in medicine. However, their performance in specialized domains\nlike ophthalmology remains underexplored. This study comprehensively evaluated\nand compared the accuracy and reasoning capabilities of four newly developed\nreasoning-focused LLMs, namely DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o1, o3-mini, and Gemini 2.0\nFlash-Thinking. Each model was assessed using 5,888 multiple-choice\nophthalmology exam questions from the MedMCQA dataset in zero-shot setting.\nQuantitative evaluation included accuracy, Macro-F1, and five text-generation\nmetrics (ROUGE-L, METEOR, BERTScore, BARTScore, and AlignScore), computed\nagainst ground-truth reasonings. Average inference time was recorded for a\nsubset of 100 randomly selected questions. Additionally, two board-certified\nophthalmologists qualitatively assessed clarity, completeness, and reasoning\nstructure of responses to differential diagnosis questions.O1 (0.902) and\nDeepSeek-R1 (0.888) achieved the highest accuracy, with o1 also leading in\nMacro-F1 (0.900). The performance of models across the text-generation metrics\nvaried: O3-mini excelled in ROUGE-L (0.151), o1 in METEOR (0.232), DeepSeek-R1\nand o3-mini tied for BERTScore (0.673), DeepSeek-R1 (-4.105) and Gemini 2.0\nFlash-Thinking (-4.127) performed best in BARTScore, while o3-mini (0.181) and\no1 (0.176) led AlignScore. Inference time across the models varied, with\nDeepSeek-R1 being slowest (40.4 seconds) and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking fastest\n(6.7 seconds). Qualitative evaluation revealed that DeepSeek-R1 and Gemini 2.0\nFlash-Thinking tended to provide detailed and comprehensive intermediate\nreasoning, whereas o1 and o3-mini displayed concise and summarized\njustifications.",

Despite the impressive progress, the safety of LLM-based RecSys\nagainst backdoor attacks remains largely under-explored. In this paper, we\nraise a new problem: Can a backdoor with a specific trigger be injected into\nLLM-based Recsys, leading to the manipulation of the recommendation responses\nwhen the backdoor trigger is appended to an item's title? To investigate the\nvulnerabilities of LLM-based RecSys under backdoor attacks, we propose a new\nattack framework termed Backdoor Injection Poisoning for RecSys (BadRec).\nBadRec perturbs the items' titles with triggers and employs several fake users\nto interact with these items, effectively poisoning the training set and\ninjecting backdoors into LLM-based RecSys. Comprehensive experiments reveal\nthat poisoning just 1% of the training data with adversarial examples is\nsufficient to successfully implant backdoors, enabling manipulation of\nrecommendations. To further mitigate such a security threat, we propose a\nuniversal defense strategy called Poison Scanner (P-Scanner). Specifically, we\nintroduce an LLM-based poison scanner to detect the poisoned items by\nleveraging the powerful language understanding and rich knowledge of LLMs. A\ntrigger augmentation agent is employed to generate diverse synthetic triggers\nto guide the poison scanner in learning domain-specific knowledge of the\npoisoned item detection task. Extensive experiments on three real-world\ndatasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed P-Scanner.",

Social media platforms amplify the\nimpact of sexism by conveying discriminatory content not only through text but\nalso across multiple modalities, highlighting the critical need for a\nmultimodal approach to the analysis of sexism online. With the rise of social\nmedia platforms where users share short videos, sexism is increasingly\nspreading through video content. Automatically detecting sexism in videos is a\nchallenging task, as it requires analyzing the combination of verbal, audio,\nand visual elements to identify sexist content. In this study, (1) we introduce\nMuSeD, a new Multimodal Spanish dataset for Sexism Detection consisting of\n$\\approx$ 11 hours of videos extracted from TikTok and BitChute; (2) we propose\nan innovative annotation framework for analyzing the contribution of textual\nand multimodal labels in the classification of sexist and non-sexist content;\nand (3) we evaluate a range of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs\non the task of sexism detection. We find that visual information plays a key\nrole in labeling sexist content for both humans and models. Models effectively\ndetect explicit sexism; however, they struggle with implicit cases, such as\nstereotypes, instances where annotators also show low agreement.

Furthermore, we introduce a new\ncascaded attention module named Multi-Scale Global Local Attention Module\n(MS-GLAM). Through a customized cascaded attention structure, it effectively\nfocuses on global and local information at multiple scales, further enhancing\nthe information from the Disentangler. Finally, the global gaze-relevant\nfeatures disentangled by the upper face branch, combined with head pose and\nlocal eye features, are passed through the detection head for high-precision\ngaze estimation.

To establish this\nresult, we first demonstrate the strictly positive definiteness of the NTKs for\nmulti-layer FCNs and ResNets. Then, we prove that during training, % with the\ncross-entropy loss, the neural network parameters diverge if the smallest\neigenvalue of the empirical NTK matrix (Gram matrix) with respect to training\nsamples is bounded below by a positive constant. This behavior contrasts\nsharply with the lazy training regime commonly observed in regression problems.\nConsequently, using a proof by contradiction, we show that the empirical NTK\ndoes not uniformly converge to the NTK across all times on the training samples\nas the network width increases. We validate our theoretical results through\nexperiments on both synthetic data and the MNIST classification task.

In particular, we investigate the mechanisms to\ngenerate training data sets and construct the end-to-end pipeline to fine-tune\npre-trained LLMs that produce parameterized quantum circuits for optimization\nproblems.

The fine-tuned LLMs can\nconstruct syntactically correct parametrized quantum circuits in the most\nrecent OpenQASM 3.0. We have evaluated the quality of the parameters by\ncomparing them to the optimized expectation values and distributions. Our\nevaluation shows that the fine-tuned LLM outperforms state-of-the-art models\nand that the parameters are better than random.
