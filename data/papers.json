      "abstract": "Diffusion models are widely used for image editing tasks. Existing editing\nmethods often design a representation manipulation procedure by curating an\nedit direction in the text embedding or score space. However, such a procedure\nfaces a key challenge: overestimating the edit strength harms visual\nconsistency while underestimating it fails the editing task. Notably, each\nsource image may require a different editing strength, and it is costly to\nsearch for an appropriate strength via trial-and-error. To address this\nchallenge, we propose Concept Lancet (CoLan), a zero-shot plug-and-play\nframework for principled representation manipulation in diffusion-based image\nediting. At inference time, we decompose the source input in the latent (text\nembedding or diffusion score) space as a sparse linear combination of the\nrepresentations of the collected visual concepts. This allows us to accurately\nestimate the presence of concepts in each image, which informs the edit. Based\non the editing task (replace/add/remove), we perform a customized concept\ntransplant process to impose the corresponding editing direction. To\nsufficiently model the concept space, we curate a conceptual representation\ndataset, CoLan-150K, which contains diverse descriptions and scenarios of\nvisual terms and phrases for the latent dictionary. Experiments on multiple\ndiffusion-based image editing baselines show that methods equipped with CoLan\nachieve state-of-the-art performance in editing effectiveness and consistency\npreservation.",

This raises\nthe question of whether Transformer models are real reasoning engines, despite\ntheir impressive abilities in mathematical problem solving and code synthesis.\nIn this paper, we offer a vanishing variance perspective on this issue. To the\nbest of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that even for today's\nfrontier models, a longer sequence length results in a decrease in variance in\nthe output of the multi-head attention modules. On the argmax retrieval and\ndictionary lookup tasks, our experiments show that applying layer normalization\nafter the attention outputs leads to significantly better length\ngeneralization. Our analyses attribute this improvement to a reduction-though\nnot a complete elimination-of the distribution shift caused by vanishing\nvariance.",

We show the same story is true for AI\nscientists.

      "abstract": "Symmetry, where certain features remain invariant under geometric\ntransformations, can often serve as a powerful prior in designing convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs). While conventional CNNs inherently support\ntranslational equivariance, extending this property to rotation and reflection\nhas proven challenging, often forcing a compromise between equivariance,\nefficiency, and information loss. In this work, we introduce Gaussian Mixture\nRing Convolution (GMR-Conv), an efficient convolution kernel that smooths\nradial symmetry using a mixture of Gaussian-weighted rings. This design\nmitigates discretization errors of circular kernels, thereby preserving robust\nrotation and reflection equivariance without incurring computational overhead.\nWe further optimize both the space and speed efficiency of GMR-Conv via a novel\nparameterization and computation strategy, allowing larger kernels at an\nacceptable cost. Extensive experiments on eight classification and one\nsegmentation datasets demonstrate that GMR-Conv not only matches conventional\nCNNs' performance but can also surpass it in applications with orientation-less\ndata. GMR-Conv is also proven to be more robust and efficient than the\nstate-of-the-art equivariant learning methods. Our work provides inspiring\nempirical evidence that carefully applied radial symmetry can alleviate the\nchallenges of information loss, marking a promising advance in equivariant\nnetwork architectures.

Our\nfindings reveal that many LLMs have outperformed university-level performance\non easy reasoning tasks, and reasoning-scaled LLMs reach university-level\nperformance on complex reasoning challenges. Moreover, LLM performance on KUMO\ntasks correlates strongly with results on newly released real-world reasoning\nbenchmarks, underscoring KUMO's value as a robust, enduring assessment tool for\ngenuine LLM reasoning capabilities.",

      "abstract": "Imitation learning has emerged as a promising approach towards building\ngeneralist robots. However, scaling imitation learning for large robot\nfoundation models remains challenging due to its reliance on high-quality\nexpert demonstrations. Meanwhile, large amounts of video data depicting a wide\nrange of environments and diverse behaviors are readily available. This data\nprovides a rich source of information about real-world dynamics and\nagent-environment interactions. Leveraging this data directly for imitation\nlearning, however, has proven difficult due to the lack of action annotation\nrequired for most contemporary methods. In this work, we present Unified World\nModels (UWM), a framework that allows for leveraging both video and action data\nfor policy learning. Specifically, a UWM integrates an action diffusion process\nand a video diffusion process within a unified transformer architecture, where\nindependent diffusion timesteps govern each modality. We show that by simply\ncontrolling each diffusion timestep, UWM can flexibly represent a policy, a\nforward dynamics, an inverse dynamics, and a video generator. Through simulated\nand real-world experiments, we show that: (1) UWM enables effective pretraining\non large-scale multitask robot datasets with both dynamics and action\npredictions, resulting in more generalizable and robust policies than imitation\nlearning, (2) UWM naturally facilitates learning from action-free video data\nthrough independent control of modality-specific diffusion timesteps, further\nimproving the performance of finetuned policies. Our results suggest that UWM\noffers a promising step toward harnessing large, heterogeneous datasets for\nscalable robot learning, and provides a simple unification between the often\ndisparate paradigms of imitation learning and world modeling.

This pattern persists across scientific domains despite significant\nfield-specific variations in existence rates, which refer to the proportion of\ngenerated references that match existing records in external bibliometric\ndatabases. Analyzing 274,951 references generated by GPT-4o for 10,000 papers,\nwe find that LLM recommendations diverge from traditional citation patterns by\npreferring more recent references with shorter titles and fewer authors.\nEmphasizing their content-level relevance, the generated references are\nsemantically aligned with the content of each paper at levels comparable to the\nground truth references and display similar network effects while reducing\nauthor self-citations. These findings illustrate how LLMs may reshape citation\npractices and influence the trajectory of scientific discovery by reflecting\nand amplifying established trends. As LLMs become more integrated into the\nscientific research process, it is important to understand their role in\nshaping how scientific communities discover and build upon prior work.",

Existing methods, which\nemploy video generation models to synthesize novel views, suffer from limited\nvideo length and scene inconsistency, leading to artifacts and distortions\nduring further reconstruction. To address this issue, we construct noisy\nsamples from original features as momentum to enhance video details and\nmaintain scene consistency. However, for latent features with the perception\nfield that spans both known and unknown regions, such latent-level momentum\nrestricts the generative ability of video diffusion in unknown regions.\nTherefore, we further introduce the aforementioned consistent video as a\npixel-level momentum to a directly generated video without momentum for better\nrecovery of unseen regions. Our cascaded momentum enables video diffusion\nmodels to generate both high-fidelity and consistent novel views. We further\nfinetune the global Gaussian representations with enhanced frames and render\nnew frames for momentum update in the next step. In this manner, we can\niteratively recover a 3D scene, avoiding the limitation of video length.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the generalization capability and superior\nperformance of our method in high-fidelity and consistent scene generation.",

In this paper, we propose a novel supervised\ncontrastive multimodal framework, SCMPPI, for PPI prediction.

For the PPI task, SCMPPI introduces a negative sample filtering\nmechanism and modifies the contrastive loss function, effectively optimizing\nmultimodal features. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets, including yeast,\nhuman, and H.pylori, show that SCMPPI outperforms existing state-of-the-art\nmethods (such as DF-PPI and TAGPPI) in key metrics such as accuracy ( 98.01%)\nand AUC (99.62%), and demonstrates strong generalization in cross-species\nprediction (AUC > 99% on multi-species datasets).

As an initial contribution, we release a\nset of 4,723 well-structured instances spanning seven programming languages,\nlaying a solid foundation for RL research in this domain. More importantly, we\nopen-source our entire data production pipeline, along with detailed tutorials,\nencouraging the open-source community to continuously contribute and expand the\ndataset.

      "abstract": "The recent advancements in Deep Learning models and techniques have led to\nsignificant strides in performance across diverse tasks and modalities.\nHowever, while the overall capabilities of models show promising growth, our\nunderstanding of their internal reasoning processes remains limited,\nparticularly concerning systematic inconsistencies or errors patterns of\nlogical or inferential flaws. These inconsistencies may manifest as\ncontradictory outputs, failure to generalize across similar tasks, or erroneous\nconclusions in specific contexts. Even detecting and measuring such reasoning\ndiscrepancies is challenging, as they may arise from opaque internal\nprocedures, biases and imbalances in training data, or the inherent complexity\nof the task. Without effective methods to detect, measure, and mitigate these\nerrors, there is a risk of deploying models that are biased, exploitable, or\nlogically unreliable. This thesis aims to address these issues by producing\nnovel methods for deep learning models that reason over knowledge graphs,\nnatural language, and images. The thesis contributes two techniques for\ndetecting and quantifying predictive inconsistencies originating from opaque\ninternal procedures in natural language and image processing models. To\nmitigate inconsistencies from biases in training data, this thesis presents a\ndata efficient sampling method to improve fairness and performance and a\nsynthetic dataset generation approach in low resource scenarios. Finally, the\nthesis offers two techniques to optimize the models for complex reasoning\ntasks. These methods enhance model performance while allowing for more faithful\nand interpretable exploration and exploitation during inference.

Moreover, it is\ninjective on measures and bi-Lipschitz on multisets - a significant advantage\nover prevalent methods based on sum- or max-pooling, which are provably not\nbi-Lipschitz, and, in many cases, not even injective.

Thus, the metric\nproperties of our embedding are, in a sense, the best possible.\n  Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method yields superior\nmultiset representations that improve performance in practical learning tasks.\nSpecifically, we show that (a) a simple combination of the FSW embedding with\nan MLP achieves state-of-the-art performance in learning the (non-sliced)\nWasserstein distance; and (b) replacing max-pooling with the FSW embedding\nmakes PointNet significantly more robust to parameter reduction, with only\nminor performance degradation even after a 40-fold reduction.",

A key challenge of\nRL is to obtain accurate reward signals for LLMs in various domains beyond\nverifiable questions or artificial rules.

To address this\nissue in the framework of the Industrial Internet Robot Collaboration System,\nthis paper proposes a global path control scheme for mobile robots based on\ndeep learning. First of all, the dynamic equation of the mobile robot is\nestablished. According to the linear velocity and angular velocity of the\nmobile robot, its motion behaviors are divided into obstacle - avoidance\nbehavior, target - turning behavior, and target approaching behavior.\nSubsequently, the neural network method in deep learning is used to build a\nglobal path planning model for the robot. On this basis, a fuzzy controller is\ndesigned with the help of a fuzzy control algorithm to correct the deviations\nthat occur during path planning, thereby achieving optimized control of the\nrobot's global path. In addition, considering edge computing optimization, the\nproposed model can process local data at the edge device, reducing the\ncommunication burden between the robot and the central server, and improving\nthe real time performance of path planning. The experimental results show that\nfor the mobile robot controlled by the research method in this paper, the\ndeviation distance of the path angle is within 5 cm, the deviation convergence\ncan be completed within 10 ms, and the planned path is shorter.

      "abstract": "Program-guided reasoning has shown promise in complex claim fact-checking by\ndecomposing claims into function calls and executing reasoning programs.\nHowever, prior work primarily relies on few-shot in-context learning (ICL) with\nad-hoc demonstrations, which limit program diversity and require manual design\nwith substantial domain knowledge. Fundamentally, the underlying principles of\neffective reasoning program generation still remain underexplored, making it\nchallenging to construct effective demonstrations. To address this, we propose\nBOOST, a bootstrapping-based framework for few-shot reasoning program\ngeneration. BOOST explicitly integrates claim decomposition and\ninformation-gathering strategies as structural guidance for program generation,\niteratively refining bootstrapped demonstrations in a strategy-driven and\ndata-centric manner without human intervention. This enables a seamless\ntransition from zero-shot to few-shot strategic program-guided learning,\nenhancing interpretability and effectiveness. Experimental results show that\nBOOST outperforms prior few-shot baselines in both zero-shot and few-shot\nsettings for complex claim verification.",

      "abstract": "3D object detection aims to predict object centers, dimensions, and rotations\nfrom LiDAR point clouds. Despite its simplicity, LiDAR captures only the near\nside of objects, making center-based detectors prone to poor localization\naccuracy in cross-domain tasks with varying point distributions. Meanwhile,\nexisting evaluation metrics designed for single-domain assessment also suffer\nfrom overfitting due to dataset-specific size variations. A key question\narises: Do we really need models to maintain excellent performance in the\nentire 3D bounding boxes after being applied across domains? Actually, one of\nour main focuses is on preventing collisions between vehicles and other\nobstacles, especially in cross-domain scenarios where correctly predicting the\nsizes is much more difficult. To address these issues, we rethink cross-domain\n3D object detection from a practical perspective. We propose two new metrics\nthat evaluate a model's ability to detect objects' closer-surfaces to the LiDAR\nsensor. Additionally, we introduce EdgeHead, a refinement head that guides\nmodels to focus more on learnable closer surfaces, significantly improving\ncross-domain performance under both our new and traditional BEV/3D metrics.\nFurthermore, we argue that predicting the nearest corner rather than the object\ncenter enhances robustness. We propose a novel 3D object detector, coined as\nCornerPoint3D, which is built upon CenterPoint and uses heatmaps to supervise\nthe learning and detection of the nearest corner of each object. Our proposed\nmethods realize a balanced trade-off between the detection quality of entire\nbounding boxes and the locating accuracy of closer surfaces to the LiDAR\nsensor, outperforming the traditional center-based detector CenterPoint in\nmultiple cross-domain tasks and providing a more practically reasonable and\nrobust cross-domain 3D object detection solution.",

In this paper,\nwe argue for the reification of fairness not only as a property of ADM, but\nalso as an epistemic right of an individual to acquire information about the\ndecisions that affect them and use that information to contest and seek\neffective redress against those decisions, in case they are proven to be\ndiscriminatory. We examine key concepts from existing research not only in\nalgorithmic fairness but also in explainable artificial intelligence,\naccountability, and contestability. Integrating notions from these domains, we\npropose a conceptual framework to ascertain fairness by combining different\ntools that empower the end-users of ADM systems. Our framework shifts the focus\nfrom technical solutions aimed at practitioners to mechanisms that enable\nindividuals to understand, challenge, and verify the fairness of decisions, and\nalso serves as a blueprint for organizations and policymakers, bridging the gap\nbetween technical requirements and practical, user-centered accountability.",

Despite the remarkable success, existing LLM-empowered RecSys have\nbeen demonstrated to be highly vulnerable to minor perturbations. To mitigate\nthe negative impact of such vulnerabilities, one potential solution is to\nemploy collaborative signals based on item-item co-occurrence to purify the\nmalicious collaborative knowledge from the user's historical interactions\ninserted by attackers. On the other hand, due to the capabilities to expand\ninsufficient internal knowledge of LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\ntechniques provide unprecedented opportunities to enhance the robustness of\nLLM-empowered recommender systems by introducing external collaborative\nknowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel framework (RETURN) by\nretrieving external collaborative signals to purify the poisoned user profiles\nand enhance the robustness of LLM-empowered RecSys in a plug-and-play manner.\nSpecifically, retrieval-augmented perturbation positioning is proposed to\nidentify potential perturbations within the users' historical sequences by\nretrieving external knowledge from collaborative item graphs. After that, we\nfurther retrieve the collaborative knowledge to cleanse the perturbations by\nusing either deletion or replacement strategies and introduce a robust ensemble\nrecommendation strategy to generate final robust predictions.

By introducing the Level-k behavioral game theory, the paper\nmodels the decision-making process of human drivers and employs deep\nreinforcement learning to train the models with diverse decision styles,\nsimulating different reasoning approaches and behavioral characteristics.\nBuilding on the Poisson cognitive hierarchy theory, this paper also presents a\nnovel driving scenario generation method. The method controls the proportion of\nvehicles with different driving styles in the scenario using Poisson and\nbinomial distributions, thus generating controllable and diverse driving\nenvironments. Experimental results demonstrate that CHARMS not only exhibits\nsuperior decision-making capabilities as ego vehicles, but also generates more\ncomplex and diverse driving scenarios as surrounding vehicles.
