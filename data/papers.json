      "abstract": "Recent advances in large multimodal models have leveraged image-based tools\nwith reinforcement learning to tackle visual problems. However, existing\nopen-source approaches often exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and allow\nonly a limited number of interaction turns, making them inadequate for\ndifficult tasks that require trial-and-error exploration. In this work, we\naddress this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce\nMini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of\nsteps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search\ntasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key\ncomponents. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of\nthousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory\nreasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain\ncold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including\ndepth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an\nover-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses\n(those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning,\nthereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite\ntraining with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates\ntrajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with\naccuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking\npaths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems.",

      "abstract": "We develop new experimental paradigms for measuring welfare in language\nmodels. We compare verbal reports of models about their preferences with\npreferences expressed through behavior when navigating a virtual environment\nand selecting conversation topics. We also test how costs and rewards affect\nbehavior and whether responses to an eudaimonic welfare scale - measuring\nstates such as autonomy and purpose in life - are consistent across\nsemantically equivalent prompts. Overall, we observed a notable degree of\nmutual support between our measures. The reliable correlations observed between\nstated preferences and behavior across conditions suggest that preference\nsatisfaction can, in principle, serve as an empirically measurable welfare\nproxy in some of today's AI systems. Furthermore, our design offered an\nilluminating setting for qualitative observation of model behavior. Yet, the\nconsistency between measures was more pronounced in some models and conditions\nthan others and responses were not consistent across perturbations. Due to\nthis, and the background uncertainty about the nature of welfare and the\ncognitive states (and welfare subjecthood) of language models, we are currently\nuncertain whether our methods successfully measure the welfare state of\nlanguage models. Nevertheless, these findings highlight the feasibility of\nwelfare measurement in language models, inviting further exploration.",

      "abstract": "Code generation has emerged as a pivotal capability of Large Language\nModels(LLMs), revolutionizing development efficiency for programmers of all\nskill levels. However, the complexity of data structures and algorithmic logic\noften results in functional deficiencies and security vulnerabilities in\ngenerated code, reducing it to a prototype requiring extensive manual\ndebugging. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can enhance correctness\nand security by leveraging external code manuals, it simultaneously introduces\nnew attack surfaces.\n  In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of attack surfaces in\nRetrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG), focusing on malicious dependency\nhijacking. We demonstrate how poisoned documentation containing hidden\nmalicious dependencies (e.g., matplotlib_safe) can subvert RACG, exploiting\ndual trust chains: LLM reliance on RAG and developers' blind trust in LLM\nsuggestions. To construct poisoned documents, we propose ImportSnare, a novel\nattack framework employing two synergistic strategies: 1)Position-aware beam\nsearch optimizes hidden ranking sequences to elevate poisoned documents in\nretrieval results, and 2)Multilingual inductive suggestions generate\njailbreaking sequences to manipulate LLMs into recommending malicious\ndependencies. Through extensive experiments across Python, Rust, and\nJavaScript, ImportSnare achieves significant attack success rates (over 50% for\npopular libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn) in general, and is also able\nto succeed even when the poisoning ratio is as low as 0.01%, targeting both\ncustom and real-world malicious packages. Our findings reveal critical supply\nchain risks in LLM-powered development, highlighting inadequate security\nalignment for code generation tasks.

      "abstract": "As local AI grows in popularity, there is a critical gap between the\nbenchmark performance of object detectors and their practical viability on\nconsumer-grade hardware. While models like YOLOv10s promise real-time speeds,\nthese metrics are typically achieved on high-power, desktop-class GPUs. This\npaper reveals that on resource-constrained systems, such as laptops with RTX\n4060 GPUs, performance is not compute-bound but is instead dominated by\nsystem-level bottlenecks, as illustrated by a simple bottleneck test. To\novercome this hardware-level constraint, we introduce a Two-Pass Adaptive\nInference algorithm, a model-independent approach that requires no\narchitectural changes. This study mainly focuses on adaptive inference\nstrategies and undertakes a comparative analysis of architectural early-exit\nand resolution-adaptive routing, highlighting their respective trade-offs\nwithin a unified evaluation framework. The system uses a fast, low-resolution\npass and only escalates to a high-resolution model pass when detection\nconfidence is low. On a 5000-image COCO dataset, our method achieves a 1.85x\nspeedup over a PyTorch Early-Exit baseline, with a modest mAP loss of 5.51%.\nThis work provides a practical and reproducible blueprint for deploying\nhigh-performance, real-time AI on consumer-grade devices by shifting the focus\nfrom pure model optimization to hardware-aware inference strategies that\nmaximize throughput.",

These models operate with a thinking\nbudget, that is, a predefined number of reasoning tokens used to arrive at a\nsolution. We propose a novel approach, inspired by the generator/discriminator\nframework in generative adversarial networks, in which a critic model\nperiodically probes its own reasoning to assess whether it has reached a\nconfident conclusion. If not, reasoning continues until a target certainty\nthreshold is met. This mechanism adaptively balances efficiency and reliability\nby allowing early termination when confidence is high, while encouraging\nfurther reasoning when uncertainty persists. Through experiments on the\nAIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets, we show that Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR)\nimproves baseline accuracy while reducing token usage. Importantly, extended\nmulti-seed evaluations over 64 runs demonstrate that CGR is stable, reducing\nvariance across seeds and improving exam-like performance under penalty-based\ngrading. Additionally, our token savings analysis shows that CGR can eliminate\nmillions of tokens in aggregate, with tunable trade-offs between certainty\nthresholds and efficiency. Together, these findings highlight certainty as a\npowerful signal for reasoning sufficiency. By integrating confidence into the\nreasoning process, CGR makes large reasoning language models more adaptive,\ntrustworthy, and resource efficient, paving the way for practical deployment in\ndomains where both accuracy and computational cost matter.",

We\nperformed a large-scale empirical study to analyze developers refactoring\nactivity, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify underlying\nmotivations from version control data, comparing our findings with previous\nmotivations reported in the literature. Results. LLMs matched human judgment in\n80% of cases, but aligned with literature-based motivations in only 47%.

Most motivations were\npragmatic, focused on simplification and maintainability. While metrics related\nto developer experience and code readability ranked highest, their correlation\nwith motivation categories was weak. Conclusions. We conclude that LLMs\neffectively capture surface-level motivations but struggle with architectural\nreasoning. Their value lies in providing localized explanations, which, when\ncombined with software metrics, can form hybrid approaches.

      "abstract": "Deep learning offers a promising avenue for automating many recognition tasks\nin fields such as medicine and forensics. However, the black-box nature of\nthese models hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications where trust and\naccountability are required. For 3D shape recognition tasks in particular, this\npaper introduces the Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT) architecture to\naddress this need. Applied to 3D meshes of third molars derived from CBCT\nimages, for Demirjian stage allocation, CGAT utilizes graph attention\nconvolutions and an inherent attention mechanism, visualized via attention\nrollout, to explain its decision-making process. We evaluated the local mean\ncurvature and distance to centroid node features, both individually and in\ncombination, as well as model depth, finding that models incorporating directed\nedges to a global CLS node produced more intuitive attention maps, while also\nyielding desirable classification performance. We analyzed the attention-based\nexplanations of the models, and their predictive performances to propose\noptimal settings for the CGAT. The combination of local mean curvature and\ndistance to centroid as node features yielded a slight performance increase\nwith 0.76 weighted F1 score, and more comprehensive attention visualizations.\nThe CGAT architecture's ability to generate human-understandable attention maps\ncan enhance trust and facilitate expert validation of model decisions. While\ndemonstrated on dental data, CGAT is broadly applicable to graph-based\nclassification and regression tasks, promoting wider adoption of transparent\nand competitive deep learning models in high-stakes environments.",

This paper presents a novel framework for\ninterpretable-by-design neural system dynamics modeling that synergizes DL with\ntechniques from Concept-Based Interpretability, Mechanistic Interpretability,\nand Causal Machine Learning. The proposed hybrid approach enables the\nconstruction of neural network models that operate on semantically meaningful\nand actionable variables, while retaining the causal grounding and transparency\ntypical of traditional SD models. The framework is conceived to be applied to\nreal-world case-studies from the EU-funded project AutoMoTIF, focusing on\ndata-driven decision support, automation, and optimization of multimodal\nlogistic terminals.

This diversity presents a\nfundamental routing challenge: how to accurately direct each query to an\nappropriate execution unit while optimizing both performance and efficiency. To\naddress this, we propose MoMA (Mixture of Models and Agents), a generalized\nrouting framework that integrates both LLM and agent-based routing. Built upon\na deep understanding of model and agent capabilities, MoMA effectively handles\ndiverse queries through precise intent recognition and adaptive routing\nstrategies, achieving an optimal balance between efficiency and cost.\nSpecifically, we construct a detailed training dataset to profile the\ncapabilities of various LLMs under different routing model structures,\nidentifying the most suitable tasks for each LLM. During inference, queries are\ndynamically routed to the LLM with the best cost-performance efficiency. We\nalso introduce an efficient agent selection strategy based on a context-aware\nstate machine and dynamic masking.

We find that although existing\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based KE methods excel at editing simple\nknowledge, they struggle with KE in multi-hop question answering due to the\nissue of \"edit skipping\", which refers to skipping the relevant edited fact in\ninference. In addition to the diversity of natural language expressions of\nknowledge, edit skipping also arises from the mismatch between the granularity\nof LLMs in problem-solving and the facts in the edited memory. To address this\nissue, we propose a novel Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Editing\nmethod with guided decomposition (IRAKE) through the guidance from single\nedited facts and entire edited cases.
