      "abstract": "WonderPlay is a novel framework integrating physics simulation with video\ngeneration for generating action-conditioned dynamic 3D scenes from a single\nimage. While prior works are restricted to rigid body or simple elastic\ndynamics, WonderPlay features a hybrid generative simulator to synthesize a\nwide range of 3D dynamics. The hybrid generative simulator first uses a physics\nsolver to simulate coarse 3D dynamics, which subsequently conditions a video\ngenerator to produce a video with finer, more realistic motion. The generated\nvideo is then used to update the simulated dynamic 3D scene, closing the loop\nbetween the physics solver and the video generator. This approach enables\nintuitive user control to be combined with the accurate dynamics of\nphysics-based simulators and the expressivity of diffusion-based video\ngenerators. Experimental results demonstrate that WonderPlay enables users to\ninteract with various scenes of diverse content, including cloth, sand, snow,\nliquid, smoke, elastic, and rigid bodies -- all using a single image input.\nCode will be made public.

      "abstract": "This position paper argues that the theoretical inconsistency often observed\namong Responsible AI (RAI) metrics, such as differing fairness definitions or\ntradeoffs between accuracy and privacy, should be embraced as a valuable\nfeature rather than a flaw to be eliminated. We contend that navigating these\ninconsistencies, by treating metrics as divergent objectives, yields three key\nbenefits: (1) Normative Pluralism: Maintaining a full suite of potentially\ncontradictory metrics ensures that the diverse moral stances and stakeholder\nvalues inherent in RAI are adequately represented. (2) Epistemological\nCompleteness: The use of multiple, sometimes conflicting, metrics allows for a\nmore comprehensive capture of multifaceted ethical concepts, thereby preserving\ngreater informational fidelity about these concepts than any single, simplified\ndefinition. (3) Implicit Regularization: Jointly optimizing for theoretically\nconflicting objectives discourages overfitting to one specific metric, steering\nmodels towards solutions with enhanced generalization and robustness under\nreal-world complexities. In contrast, efforts to enforce theoretical\nconsistency by simplifying or pruning metrics risk narrowing this value\ndiversity, losing conceptual depth, and degrading model performance. We\ntherefore advocate for a shift in RAI theory and practice: from getting trapped\nin inconsistency to characterizing acceptable inconsistency thresholds and\nelucidating the mechanisms that permit robust, approximated consistency in\npractice.",

However, RLHF often\nsuffers from reward model overoptimisation, in which models overfit to the\nreward function, resulting in non-generalisable policies that exploit the\nidiosyncrasies and peculiarities of the reward function. A common mitigation is\niterated RLHF, in which reward models are repeatedly retrained with updated\nhuman feedback and policies are re-optimised. Despite its increasing adoption,\nthe dynamics of overoptimisation in this setting remain poorly understood. In\nthis work, we present the first comprehensive study of overoptimisation in\niterated RLHF. We systematically analyse key design choices - how reward model\ntraining data is transferred across iterations, which reward function is used\nfor optimisation, and how policies are initialised. Using the controlled\nAlpacaFarm benchmark, we observe that overoptimisation tends to decrease over\nsuccessive iterations, as reward models increasingly approximate ground-truth\npreferences. However, performance gains diminish over time, and while\nreinitialising from the base policy is robust, it limits optimisation\nflexibility.

We attribute these phase transitions to a capacity\nallocation phenomenon: a model with bounded capacity must act like a knapsack\nproblem solver to minimize the overall test loss, and the optimal allocation\nacross datasets can change discontinuously as the model size or mixing ratio\nvaries. We formalize this intuition in an information-theoretic framework and\nreveal that these phase transitions are predictable, with the critical mixing\nratio following a power-law relationship with the model size.

      "abstract": "The success of Deepseek-R1 has drawn the LLM community's attention to\nreinforcement learning (RL) methods like GRPO. However, such rule-based 0/1\noutcome reward methods lack the capability to regulate the intermediate\nreasoning processes during chain-of-thought (CoT) generation, leading to severe\noverthinking phenomena. In response, recent studies have designed reward\nfunctions to reinforce models' behaviors in producing shorter yet correct\ncompletions. Nevertheless, we observe that these length-penalty reward\nfunctions exacerbate RL training instability: as the completion length\ndecreases, model accuracy abruptly collapses, often occurring early in\ntraining. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective solution\nGRPO-$\\lambda$, an efficient and stabilized variant of GRPO, which dynamically\nadjusts the reward strategy by monitoring the correctness ratio among\ncompletions within each query-sampled group. A low correctness ratio indicates\nthe need to avoid length penalty that compromises CoT quality, triggering a\nswitch to length-agnostic 0/1 rewards that prioritize reasoning capability. A\nhigh ratio maintains length penalties to boost efficiency. Experimental results\nshow that our approach avoids training instability caused by length penalty\nwhile maintaining the optimal accuracy-efficiency trade-off. On the GSM8K,\nGPQA, MATH-500, AMC 2023, and AIME 2024 benchmarks, it improves average\naccuracy by 1.48% while reducing CoT sequence length by 47.3%.",

The distributionally robust Markov decision\nprocess (DRMDP) addresses this challenge by finding a robust policy that\nperforms well under the worst-case environment within a pre-specified\nuncertainty set of transition dynamics. Its effectiveness heavily hinges on the\nproper design of these uncertainty sets, based on prior knowledge of the\ndynamics.

To tackle this issue, we\npropose a novel approach, which uses Multi-Scale Global Dense Graph\nConvolutional Networks (GCN) in the spatial domain to identify latent joint\nsynergy patterns. Moreover, we propose a Gait Non-linear Periodic Dynamics\nLearning module to effectively capture the periodic characteristics of gait in\nthe temporal domain. To support our individual gait recognition task, we have\nconstructed a comprehensive gait dataset that ensures both completeness and\nreliability. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves an\nimpressive accuracy of 94.34% on this dataset, surpassing the current\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) by 3.77%. This advancement underscores the potential of\nour approach to enhance personalized gait control in exoskeleton-assisted\ntherapy.",

In this paper, we explore how well a large language model (LLM)\nlearns to identify a black-box function from passively observed versus actively\ncollected data. We investigate the reverse-engineering capabilities of LLMs\nacross three distinct types of black-box systems, each chosen to represent\ndifferent problem domains where future autonomous AI researchers may have\nconsiderable impact: Program, Formal Language, and Math Equation. Through\nextensive experiments, we show that LLMs fail to extract information from\nobservations, reaching a performance plateau that falls short of the ideal of\nBayesian inference. However, we demonstrate that prompting LLMs to not only\nobserve but also intervene -- actively querying the black-box with specific\ninputs to observe the resulting output -- improves performance by allowing LLMs\nto test edge cases and refine their beliefs. By providing the intervention data\nfrom one LLM to another, we show that this improvement is partly a result of\nengaging in the process of generating effective interventions, paralleling\nresults in the literature on human learning. Further analysis reveals that\nengaging in intervention can help LLMs escape from two common failure modes:\novercomplication, where the LLM falsely assumes prior knowledge about the\nblack-box, and overlooking, where the LLM fails to incorporate observations.\nThese insights provide practical guidance for helping LLMs more effectively\nreverse-engineer black-box systems, supporting their use in making new\ndiscoveries.",

      "abstract": "Medical image segmentation is vital for clinical diagnosis, yet current deep\nlearning methods often demand extensive expert effort, i.e., either through\nannotating large training datasets or providing prompts at inference time for\neach new case. This paper introduces a zero-shot and automatic segmentation\npipeline that combines off-the-shelf vision-language and segmentation\nfoundation models. Given a medical image and a task definition (e.g., \"segment\nthe optic disc in an eye fundus image\"), our method uses a grounding model to\ngenerate an initial bounding box, followed by a visual prompt boosting module\nthat enhance the prompts, which are then processed by a promptable segmentation\nmodel to produce the final mask. To address the challenges of domain gap and\nresult verification, we introduce a test-time adaptation framework featuring a\nset of learnable adaptors that align the medical inputs with foundation model\nrepresentations. Its hyperparameters are optimized via Bayesian Optimization,\nguided by a proxy validation model without requiring ground-truth labels. Our\npipeline offers an annotation-efficient and scalable solution for zero-shot\nmedical image segmentation across diverse tasks. Our pipeline is evaluated on\nseven diverse medical imaging datasets and shows promising results. By proper\ndecomposition and test-time adaptation, our fully automatic pipeline performs\ncompetitively with weakly-prompted interactive foundation models.",

      "abstract": "The complexity of code reviews has driven efforts to automate review\ncomments, but prior approaches oversimplify this task by treating it as\nsnippet-level code-to-text generation and relying on text similarity metrics\nlike BLEU for evaluation. These methods overlook repository context, real-world\nmerge request evaluation, and defect detection, limiting their practicality. To\naddress these issues, we explore the full automation pipeline within the online\nrecommendation service of a company with nearly 400 million daily active users,\nanalyzing industry-grade C++ codebases comprising hundreds of thousands of\nlines of code. We identify four key challenges: 1) capturing relevant context,\n2) improving key bug inclusion (KBI), 3) reducing false alarm rates (FAR), and\n4) integrating human workflows. To tackle these, we propose 1) code slicing\nalgorithms for context extraction, 2) a multi-role LLM framework for KBI, 3) a\nfiltering mechanism for FAR reduction, and 4) a novel prompt design for better\nhuman interaction. Our approach, validated on real-world merge requests from\nhistorical fault reports, achieves a 2x improvement over standard LLMs and a\n10x gain over previous baselines. While the presented results focus on C++, the\nunderlying framework design leverages language-agnostic principles (e.g.,\nAST-based analysis), suggesting potential for broader applicability.",

Currently, various approaches exist to\nidentify the type of kidney stones. However, obtaining results through the\nreference ex vivo identification procedure can take several weeks, while in\nvivo visual recognition requires highly trained specialists. For this reason,\ndeep learning models have been developed to provide urologists with an\nautomated classification of kidney stones during ureteroscopies. Nevertheless,\na common issue with these models is the lack of training data. This\ncontribution presents a deep learning method based on few-shot learning, aimed\nat producing sufficiently discriminative features for identifying kidney stone\ntypes in endoscopic images, even with a very limited number of samples. This\napproach was specifically designed for scenarios where endoscopic images are\nscarce or where uncommon classes are present, enabling classification even with\na limited training dataset.

      "abstract": "Cross-view geo-localization determines the location of a query image,\ncaptured by a drone or ground-based camera, by matching it to a geo-referenced\nsatellite image. While traditional approaches focus on image-level\nlocalization, many applications, such as search-and-rescue, infrastructure\ninspection, and precision delivery, demand object-level accuracy. This enables\nusers to prompt a specific object with a single click on a drone image to\nretrieve precise geo-tagged information of the object. However, variations in\nviewpoints, timing, and imaging conditions pose significant challenges,\nespecially when identifying visually similar objects in extensive satellite\nimagery. To address these challenges, we propose an Object-level Cross-view\nGeo-localization Network (OCGNet). It integrates user-specified click locations\nusing Gaussian Kernel Transfer (GKT) to preserve location information\nthroughout the network. This cue is dually embedded into the feature encoder\nand feature matching blocks, ensuring robust object-specific localization.\nAdditionally, OCGNet incorporates a Location Enhancement (LE) module and a\nMulti-Head Cross Attention (MHCA) module to adaptively emphasize\nobject-specific features or expand focus to relevant contextual regions when\nnecessary. OCGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on a public dataset,\nCVOGL.

DiffusionReward effectively\novercomes the limitations of diffusion-based methods, which often fail to\ngenerate realistic facial details and exhibit poor identity consistency. The\ncore of our framework is the Face Reward Model (FRM), which is trained using\ncarefully annotated data. It provides feedback signals that play a pivotal role\nin steering the optimization process of the restoration network. In particular,\nour ReFL framework incorporates a gradient flow into the denoising process of\noff-the-shelf face restoration methods to guide the update of model parameters.\nThe guiding gradient is collaboratively determined by three aspects: (i) the\nFRM to ensure the perceptual quality of the restored faces; (ii) a\nregularization term that functions as a safeguard to preserve generative\ndiversity; and (iii) a structural consistency constraint to maintain facial\nfidelity. Furthermore, the FRM undergoes dynamic optimization throughout the\nprocess. It not only ensures that the restoration network stays precisely\naligned with the real face manifold, but also effectively prevents reward\nhacking. Experiments on synthetic and wild datasets demonstrate that our method\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving identity\nconsistency and facial details.

To reduce the prohibitive cost of relying on commercial models for\nlarge-scale evaluation, and to improve the reasoning capabilities of\nopen-source models, recent research has explored supervised fine-tuning (SFT)\nof multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as dedicated T2I evaluators.\nHowever, SFT approaches typically rely on high-quality critique datasets, which\nare either generated by proprietary LLMs-with potential issues of bias and\ninconsistency-or annotated by humans at high cost, limiting their scalability\nand generalization. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-Eval-R1, a\nnovel reinforcement learning framework that trains open-source MLLMs using only\ncoarse-grained quality scores, thereby avoiding the need for annotating\nhigh-quality interpretable evaluation rationale.
