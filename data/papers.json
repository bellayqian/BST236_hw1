      "abstract": "As language agents tackle increasingly complex tasks, they struggle with\neffective error correction and experience reuse across domains. We introduce\nAgent KB, a hierarchical experience framework that enables complex agentic\nproblem solving via a novel Reason-Retrieve-Refine pipeline. Agent KB addresses\na core limitation: agents traditionally cannot learn from each other's\nexperiences. By capturing both high-level strategies and detailed execution\nlogs, Agent KB creates a shared knowledge base that enables cross-agent\nknowledge transfer. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Agent KB improves success\nrates by up to 16.28 percentage points. On the most challenging tasks, Claude-3\nimproves from 38.46% to 57.69%, while GPT-4 improves from 53.49% to 73.26% on\nintermediate tasks. On SWE-bench code repair, Agent KB enables Claude-3 to\nimprove from 41.33% to 53.33%. Our results suggest that Agent KB provides a\nmodular, framework-agnostic infrastructure for enabling agents to learn from\npast experiences and generalize successful strategies to new tasks.",

      "abstract": "Current language-guided robotic manipulation systems often require low-level\naction-labeled datasets for imitation learning. While object-centric flow\nprediction methods mitigate this issue, they remain limited to scenarios\ninvolving rigid objects with clear displacement and minimal occlusion. In this\nwork, we present Embodiment-Centric Flow (EC-Flow), a framework that directly\nlearns manipulation from action-unlabeled videos by predicting\nembodiment-centric flow. Our key insight is that incorporating the embodiment's\ninherent kinematics significantly enhances generalization to versatile\nmanipulation scenarios, including deformable object handling, occlusions, and\nnon-object-displacement tasks. To connect the EC-Flow with language\ninstructions and object interactions, we further introduce a goal-alignment\nmodule by jointly optimizing movement consistency and goal-image prediction.\nMoreover, translating EC-Flow to executable robot actions only requires a\nstandard robot URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) file to specify\nkinematic constraints across joints, which makes it easy to use in practice. We\nvalidate EC-Flow on both simulation (Meta-World) and real-world tasks,\ndemonstrating its state-of-the-art performance in occluded object handling (62%\nimprovement), deformable object manipulation (45% improvement), and\nnon-object-displacement tasks (80% improvement) than prior state-of-the-art\nobject-centric flow methods.

Throughout extensive\nexperiments on various robot platforms, we reveal that (1) task diversity\nproves more critical than per-task demonstration quantity, benefiting transfer\nfrom diverse pre-training tasks to novel downstream scenarios; (2)\nmulti-embodiment pre-training data is optional for cross-embodiment\ntransfer-models trained on high-quality single-embodiment data can efficiently\ntransfer to different platforms, showing more desirable scaling property during\nfine-tuning than multi-embodiment pre-trained models; and (3) expert diversity,\narising from individual operational preferences and stochastic variations in\nhuman demonstrations, can be confounding to policy learning, with velocity\nmultimodality emerging as a key contributing factor. Based on this insight, we\npropose a distribution debiasing method to mitigate velocity ambiguity, the\nyielding GO-1-Pro achieves substantial performance gains of 15%, equivalent to\nusing 2.5 times pre-training data.

SQLBarber\nintroduces (i) a declarative interface for users to effortlessly generate\ncustomized SQL templates, (ii) an LLM-powered pipeline augmented with a\nself-correction module that profiles, refines, and prunes SQL templates based\non query costs, and (iii) a Bayesian Optimizer to efficiently explore different\npredicate values and identify a set of queries that satisfy the target cost\ndistribution.

We formulate the delta learning hypothesis to explain\nthis phenomenon, positing that the relative quality delta between points\nsuffices to drive learning via preference tuning--even when supervised\nfinetuning on the weak data hurts. We validate our hypothesis in controlled\nexperiments and at scale, where we post-train 8B models on preference data\ngenerated by pairing a small 3B model's responses with outputs from an even\nsmaller 1.5B model to create a meaningful delta. Strikingly, on a standard\n11-benchmark evaluation suite (MATH, MMLU, etc.), our simple recipe matches the\nperformance of Tulu 3, a state-of-the-art open model tuned from the same base\nmodel while relying on much stronger supervisors (e.g., GPT-4o). Thus, delta\nlearning enables simpler and cheaper open recipes for state-of-the-art\npost-training.

      "abstract": "Complex networks have become essential tools for understanding diverse\nphenomena in social systems, traffic systems, biomolecular systems, and\nfinancial systems. Identifying critical nodes is a central theme in\ncontemporary research, serving as a vital bridge between theoretical\nfoundations and practical applications. Nevertheless, the intrinsic complexity\nand structural heterogeneity characterizing real-world networks, with\nparticular emphasis on dynamic and higher-order networks, present substantial\nobstacles to the development of universal frameworks for critical node\nidentification. This paper provides a comprehensive review of critical node\nidentification techniques, categorizing them into seven main classes:\ncentrality, critical nodes deletion problem, influence maximization, network\ncontrol, artificial intelligence, higher-order and dynamic methods. Our review\nbridges the gaps in existing surveys by systematically classifying methods\nbased on their methodological foundations and practical implications, and by\nhighlighting their strengths, limitations, and applicability across different\nnetwork types. Our work enhances the understanding of critical node research by\nidentifying key challenges, such as algorithmic universality, real-time\nevaluation in dynamic networks, analysis of higher-order structures, and\ncomputational efficiency in large-scale networks. The structured synthesis\nconsolidates current progress and highlights open questions, particularly in\nmodeling temporal dynamics, advancing efficient algorithms, integrating machine\nlearning approaches, and developing scalable and interpretable metrics for\ncomplex systems.",

Existing\ndeep learning-based denoising methods focus primarily on pixel-level mappings,\noverlooking the potential benefits of high-level semantic guidance. Recent\nadvances in vision-language models (VLMs) suggest that language can serve as a\npowerful tool for capturing structured semantic information, offering new\nopportunities to improve LDCT reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce\nLangMamba, a Language-driven Mamba framework for LDCT denoising that leverages\nVLM-derived representations to enhance supervision from normal-dose CT (NDCT).\nLangMamba follows a two-stage learning strategy. First, we pre-train a\nLanguage-guided AutoEncoder (LangAE) that leverages frozen VLMs to map NDCT\nimages into a semantic space enriched with anatomical information. Second, we\nsynergize LangAE with two key components to guide LDCT denoising:\nSemantic-Enhanced Efficient Denoiser (SEED), which enhances NDCT-relevant local\nsemantic while capturing global features with efficient Mamba mechanism, and\nLanguage-engaged Dual-space Alignment (LangDA) Loss, which ensures that\ndenoised images align with NDCT in both perceptual and semantic spaces.\nExtensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that LangMamba\noutperforms conventional state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving\ndetail preservation and visual fidelity. Remarkably, LangAE exhibits strong\ngeneralizability to unseen datasets, thereby reducing training costs.\nFurthermore, LangDA loss improves explainability by integrating language-guided\ninsights into image reconstruction and offers a plug-and-play fashion. Our\nfindings shed new light on the potential of language as a supervisory signal to\nadvance LDCT denoising. The code is publicly available on\nhttps://github.com/hao1635/LangMamba.",

      "abstract": "This paper tackles the urgent need for efficient energy management in\nhealthcare facilities, where fluctuating demands challenge operational\nefficiency and sustainability. Traditional methods often prove inadequate,\ncausing inefficiencies and higher costs. To address this, the study presents an\nAI-based framework combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), genetic algorithm\n(GA), and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations), specifically designed for\nhealthcare energy management. Although LSTM is widely used for time-series\nforecasting, its application in healthcare energy prediction remains\nunderexplored. The results reveal that LSTM significantly outperforms ARIMA and\nProphet models in forecasting complex, non-linear demand patterns. LSTM\nachieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 21.69 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)\nof 29.96, far better than Prophet (MAE: 59.78, RMSE: 81.22) and ARIMA (MAE:\n87.73, RMSE: 125.22), demonstrating superior performance. The genetic algorithm\nis applied to optimize model parameters and improve load balancing strategies,\nenabling adaptive responses to real-time energy fluctuations. SHAP analysis\nfurther enhances model transparency by explaining the influence of different\nfeatures on predictions, fostering trust in decision-making processes. This\nintegrated LSTM-GA-SHAP approach offers a robust solution for improving\nforecasting accuracy, boosting energy efficiency, and advancing sustainability\nin healthcare facilities.

However, the consistent disadvantage of these\nmodels is that they cannot generate readable, meaningful, and correctly spelled\ntext in generated images, which significantly limits the use of practical\npurposes like advertising, learning, and creative design. This paper introduces\na new framework, namely Glyph-Conditioned Diffusion with Character-Aware\nAttention (GCDA), using which a typical diffusion backbone is extended by three\nwell-designed modules. To begin with, the model has a dual-stream text encoder\nthat encodes both semantic contextual information and explicit glyph\nrepresentations, resulting in a character-aware representation of the input\ntext that is rich in nature. Second, an attention mechanism that is aware of\nthe character is proposed with a new attention segregation loss that aims to\nlimit the attention distribution of each character independently in order to\navoid distortion artifacts. Lastly, GCDA has an OCR-in-the-loop fine-tuning\nphase, where a full text perceptual loss, directly optimises models to be\nlegible and accurately spell. Large scale experiments to benchmark datasets,\nsuch as MARIO-10M and T2I-CompBench, reveal that GCDA sets a new\nstate-of-the-art on all metrics, with better character based metrics on text\nrendering (Character Error Rate: 0.08 vs 0.21 for the previous best; Word Error\nRate: 0.15 vs 0.25), human perception, and comparable image synthesis quality\non high-fidelity (FID: 14.3).",

To address this, we propose a structured geo-registration\nand spatial correction method that aligns 3D point clouds with satellite\nimages, enabling frame-wise recovery of GNSS information and reconstruction of\ncity scale 3D maps without relying on prior localization. The proposed approach\nemploys a pre-trained Point Transformer model to segment the road points and\nthen extracts the road skeleton and intersection points from the point cloud as\nwell as the target map for alignment. Global rigid alignment of the two is\nperformed using the intersection points, followed by local refinement using\nradial basis function (RBF) interpolation. Elevation correction is then applied\nto the point cloud based on terrain information from SRTM dataset to resolve\nvertical discrepancies. The proposed method was tested on the popular KITTI\nbenchmark and a locally collected Perth (Western Australia) CBD dataset. On the\nKITTI dataset, our method achieved an average planimetric alignment standard\ndeviation (STD) of 0.84~m across sequences with intersections, representing a\n55.3\\% improvement over the original dataset. On the Perth dataset, which lacks\nGNSS information, our method achieved an average STD of 0.96~m compared to the\nGPS data extracted from Google Maps API. This corresponds to a 77.4\\%\nimprovement from the initial alignment. Our method also resulted in elevation\ncorrelation gains of 30.5\\% on the KITTI dataset and 50.4\\% on the Perth\ndataset.",

      "abstract": "Partial multi-label learning aims to extract knowledge from incompletely\nannotated data, which includes known correct labels, known incorrect labels,\nand unknown labels. The core challenge lies in accurately identifying the\nambiguous relationships between labels and instances. In this paper, we\nemphasize that matching co-occurrence patterns between labels and instances is\nkey to addressing this challenge. To this end, we propose Semantic\nCo-occurrence Insight Network (SCINet), a novel and effective framework for\npartial multi-label learning. Specifically, SCINet introduces a bi-dominant\nprompter module, which leverages an off-the-shelf multimodal model to capture\ntext-image correlations and enhance semantic alignment. To reinforce\ninstance-label interdependencies, we develop a cross-modality fusion module\nthat jointly models inter-label correlations, inter-instance relationships, and\nco-occurrence patterns across instance-label assignments. Moreover, we propose\nan intrinsic semantic augmentation strategy that enhances the model's\nunderstanding of intrinsic data semantics by applying diverse image\ntransformations, thereby fostering a synergistic relationship between label\nconfidence and sample difficulty. Extensive experiments on four widely-used\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that SCINet surpasses state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Adam is widely recognized as one of the most effective optimizers for\ntraining deep neural networks (DNNs). Despite its remarkable empirical success,\nits theoretical convergence analysis remains unsatisfactory. Existing works\npredominantly interpret Adam as a preconditioned stochastic gradient descent\nwith momentum (SGDM), formulated as $\\bm{x}_{t+1} = \\bm{x}_t -\n\\frac{\\gamma_t}{{\\sqrt{\\bm{v}_t}+\\epsilon}} \\circ \\bm{m}_t$. This perspective\nnecessitates strong assumptions and intricate techniques, resulting in lengthy\nand opaque convergence proofs that are difficult to verify and extend. In\ncontrast, we propose a novel interpretation by treating Adam as a sign-like\noptimizer, expressed as $\\bm{x}_{t+1} = \\bm{x}_t - \\gamma_t\n\\frac{|\\bm{m}_t|}{{\\sqrt{\\bm{v}_t}+\\epsilon}} \\circ {\\rm Sign}(\\bm{m}_t)$. This\nreformulation significantly simplifies the convergence analysis. For the first\ntime, with some mild conditions, we prove that Adam achieves the optimal rate\nof ${\\cal O}(\\frac{1}{T^{\\sfrac{1}{4}}})$ rather than the previous ${\\cal O}\n\\left(\\frac{\\ln T}{T^{\\sfrac{1}{4}}}\\right)$ under weak assumptions of the\ngeneralized $p$-affine variance and $(L_0, L_1, q)$-smoothness, without\ndependence on the model dimensionality or the numerical stability parameter\n$\\epsilon$. Additionally, our theoretical analysis provides new insights into\nthe role of momentum as a key factor ensuring convergence and offers practical\nguidelines for tuning learning rates in Adam, further bridging the gap between\ntheory and practice.",
