      "abstract": "This paper presents a multimodal framework that attempts to unify visual\nunderstanding and generation within a shared discrete semantic representation.\nAt its core is the Text-Aligned Tokenizer (TA-Tok), which converts images into\ndiscrete tokens using a text-aligned codebook projected from a large language\nmodel's (LLM) vocabulary. By integrating vision and text into a unified space\nwith an expanded vocabulary, our multimodal LLM, Tar, enables cross-modal input\nand output through a shared interface, without the need for modality-specific\ndesigns. Additionally, we propose scale-adaptive encoding and decoding to\nbalance efficiency and visual detail, along with a generative de-tokenizer to\nproduce high-fidelity visual outputs. To address diverse decoding needs, we\nutilize two complementary de-tokenizers: a fast autoregressive model and a\ndiffusion-based model. To enhance modality fusion, we investigate advanced\npre-training tasks, demonstrating improvements in both visual understanding and\ngeneration. Experiments across benchmarks show that Tar matches or surpasses\nexisting multimodal LLM methods, achieving faster convergence and greater\ntraining efficiency.

      "abstract": "Video generation models (VGMs) offer a promising pathway for unified world\nmodeling in robotics by integrating simulation, prediction, and manipulation.\nHowever, their practical application remains limited due to (1) slowgeneration\nspeed, which limits real-time interaction, and (2) poor consistency between\nimagined videos and executable actions. To address these challenges, we propose\nManipulate in Dream (MinD), a hierarchical diffusion-based world model\nframework that employs a dual-system design for vision-language manipulation.\nMinD executes VGM at low frequencies to extract video prediction features,\nwhile leveraging a high-frequency diffusion policy for real-time interaction.\nThis architecture enables low-latency, closed-loop control in manipulation with\ncoherent visual guidance. To better coordinate the two systems, we introduce a\nvideo-action diffusion matching module (DiffMatcher), with a novel co-training\nstrategy that uses separate schedulers for each diffusion model. Specifically,\nwe introduce a diffusion-forcing mechanism to DiffMatcher that aligns their\nintermediate representations during training, helping the fast action model\nbetter understand video-based predictions. Beyond manipulation, MinD also\nfunctions as a world simulator, reliably predicting task success or failure in\nlatent space before execution. Trustworthy analysis further shows that VGMs can\npreemptively evaluate task feasibility and mitigate risks.

      "abstract": "This work examines whether activating latent subspaces in language models\n(LLMs) can steer scientific code generation toward a specific programming\nlanguage. Five causal LLMs were first evaluated on scientific coding prompts to\nquantify their baseline bias among four programming languages. A static\nneuron-attribution method, perturbing the highest activated MLP weight for a\nC++ or CPP token, proved brittle and exhibited limited generalization across\nprompt styles and model scales. To address these limitations, a\ngradient-refined adaptive activation steering framework (G-ACT) was developed:\nper-prompt activation differences are clustered into a small set of steering\ndirections, and lightweight per-layer probes are trained and refined online to\nselect the appropriate steering vector. In LLaMA-3.2 3B, this approach reliably\nbiases generation towards the CPP language by increasing the average probe\nclassification accuracy by 15% and the early layers (0-6) improving the probe\nclassification accuracy by 61.5% compared to the standard ACT framework. For\nLLaMA-3.3 70B, where attention-head signals become more diffuse, targeted\ninjections at key layers still improve language selection. Although per-layer\nprobing introduces a modest inference overhead, it remains practical by\nsteering only a subset of layers and enables reproducible model behavior. These\nresults demonstrate a scalable, interpretable and efficient mechanism for\nconcept-level control for practical agentic systems.",

OMEGA consists of\nprogrammatically generated training-test pairs derived from templated problem\ngenerators across geometry, number theory, algebra, combinatorics, logic, and\npuzzles, with solutions verified using symbolic, numerical, or graphical\nmethods. We evaluate frontier (or top-tier) LLMs and observe sharp performance\ndegradation as problem complexity increases. Moreover, we fine-tune the\nQwen-series models across all generalization settings and observe notable\nimprovements in exploratory generalization, while compositional generalization\nremains limited and transformative reasoning shows little to no improvement.

To address this, we propose Commutative\nVector Quantization (CommVQ) to significantly reduce memory usage for\nlong-context LLM inference. We first introduce additive quantization with a\nlightweight encoder and codebook to compress the KV cache, which can be decoded\nvia simple matrix multiplication. To further reduce computational costs during\ndecoding, we design the codebook to be commutative with Rotary Position\nEmbedding (RoPE) and train it using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.\nThis enables efficient integration of decoding into the self-attention\nmechanism. Our approach achieves high accuracy with additive quantization and\nlow overhead via the RoPE-commutative codebook. Experiments on long-context\nbenchmarks and GSM8K show that our method reduces FP16 KV cache size by 87.5%\nwith 2-bit quantization, while outperforming state-of-the-art KV cache\nquantization methods. Notably, it enables 1-bit KV cache quantization with\nminimal accuracy loss, allowing a LLaMA-3.1 8B model to run with a 128K context\nlength on a single RTX 4090 GPU.

However, this strategy heavily depends on synthetic SFT\ndata, which is difficult and costly to construct, often lacks coherence and\nconsistency, and tends to be overly artificial and structurally monotonous. In\nthis work, we propose an incentivization-based approach that, starting entirely\nfrom scratch and without relying on any annotated or synthetic data, leverages\nreinforcement learning (RL) to foster the emergence of ultra-long, high-quality\ntext generation capabilities in LLMs. We perform RL training starting from a\nbase model, similar to R1-Zero, guiding it to engage in reasoning that\nfacilitates planning and refinement during the writing process. To support\nthis, we employ specialized reward models that steer the LLM towards improved\nlength control, writing quality, and structural formatting.

      "abstract": "Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) like DeepSeek-R1 and\nOpenAI o1 series have achieved notable performance enhancements on complex\nreasoning tasks by scaling up the generation length by Chain-of-Thought (CoT).\nHowever, an emerging issue is their inclination to produce excessively verbose\nreasoning processes, leading to the inefficiency problem. Existing literature\non improving efficiency mainly adheres to the before-reasoning paradigms such\nas prompting and reasoning or fine-tuning and reasoning, but ignores the\npromising direction of directly encouraging the model to speak concisely by\nintervening during the generation of reasoning. In order to fill the blank, we\npropose a framework dubbed ConciseHint, which continuously encourages the\nreasoning model to speak concisely by injecting the textual hint (manually\ndesigned or trained on the concise data) during the token generation of the\nreasoning process. Besides, ConciseHint is adaptive to the complexity of the\nquery by adaptively adjusting the hint intensity, which ensures it will not\nundermine model performance. Experiments on the state-of-the-art LRMs,\nincluding DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3 series, demonstrate that our method can\neffectively produce concise reasoning processes while maintaining performance\nwell. For instance, we achieve a reduction ratio of 65\\% for the reasoning\nlength on GSM8K benchmark with Qwen-3 4B with nearly no accuracy loss.",

In this paper, we propose Programming by\nBackprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to\nevaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without\never seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can\nproduce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the\nprogram within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the\nprogram in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more\nrobust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn\nfrom a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest\na mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to\ninternalise reusable algorithmic abstractions. Significant scope remains for\nfuture work to enable LLMs to more effectively learn from symbolic procedures,\nand progress in this direction opens other avenues like model alignment by\ntraining on formal constitutional principles.",

A biometric scheme\nis revocable if an individual can have their current enrollment in the scheme\nrevoked, so that the compromised biometric template becomes worthless, and the\nindividual can re-enroll with a new template that has similar recognition\npower. We show that modern deep CNN face matchers inherently allow for a robust\nrevocable biometric scheme. For a given state-of-the-art deep CNN backbone and\ntraining set, it is possible to generate an unlimited number of distinct face\nmatcher models that have both (1) equivalent recognition power, and (2)\nstrongly incompatible biometric templates. The equivalent recognition power\nextends to the point of generating impostor and genuine distributions that have\nthe same shape and placement on the similarity dimension, meaning that the\nmodels can share a similarity threshold for a 1-in-10,000 false match rate. The\nbiometric templates from different model instances are so strongly incompatible\nthat the cross-instance similarity score for images of the same person is\ntypically lower than the same-instance similarity score for images of different\npersons. That is, a stolen biometric template that is revoked is of less value\nin attempting to match the re-enrolled identity than the average impostor\ntemplate.

Many existing methods rely on\nmotion capture systems, pre-mapped scenes, or feature-based localization to\nensure safety and control, limiting their deployment in real-world conditions.\nWe introduce NOVA, a fully onboard, object-centric framework that enables\nrobust target tracking and collision-aware navigation using only a stereo\ncamera and an IMU. Rather than constructing a global map or relying on absolute\nlocalization, NOVA formulates perception, estimation, and control entirely in\nthe target's reference frame. A tightly integrated stack combines a lightweight\nobject detector with stereo depth completion, followed by histogram-based\nfiltering to infer robust target distances under occlusion and noise. These\nmeasurements feed a visual-inertial state estimator that recovers the full\n6-DoF pose of the robot relative to the target. A nonlinear model predictive\ncontroller (NMPC) plans dynamically feasible trajectories in the target frame.\nTo ensure safety, high-order control barrier functions are constructed online\nfrom a compact set of high-risk collision points extracted from depth, enabling\nreal-time obstacle avoidance without maps or dense representations. We validate\nNOVA across challenging real-world scenarios, including urban mazes, forest\ntrails, and repeated transitions through buildings with intermittent GPS loss\nand severe lighting changes that disrupt feature-based localization. Each\nexperiment is repeated multiple times under similar conditions to assess\nresilience, showing consistent and reliable performance.

      "abstract": "The reliance on distributed renewable energy has increased recently. As a\nresult, power electronic-based distributed generators replaced synchronous\ngenerators which led to a change in the dynamic characteristics of the\nmicrogrid. Most critically, they reduced system inertia and damping. Virtual\nsynchronous generators emulated in power electronics, which mimic the dynamic\nbehaviour of synchronous generators, are meant to fix this problem. However,\nfixed virtual synchronous generator parameters cannot guarantee a frequency\nregulation within the acceptable tolerance range. Conversely, a dynamic\nadjustment of these virtual parameters promises robust solution with stable\nfrequency. This paper proposes a method to adapt the inertia, damping, and\ndroop parameters dynamically through a fuzzy neural network controller. This\ncontroller trains itself online to choose appropriate values for these virtual\nparameters. The proposed method can be applied to a typical AC microgrid by\nconsidering the penetration and impact of renewable energy sources. We study\nthe system in a MATLAB/Simulink model and validate it experimentally in real\ntime using hardware-in-the-loop based on an embedded ARM system (SAM3X8E,\nCortex-M3). Compared to traditional and fuzzy logic controller methods, the\nresults demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces the\nfrequency deviation to less than 0.03 Hz and shortens the stabilizing/recovery\ntime.",

      "abstract": "We present a novel simulation-free framework for training continuous-time\ndiffusion processes over very general objective functions. Existing methods\ntypically involve either prescribing the optimal diffusion process -- which\nonly works for heavily restricted problem formulations -- or require expensive\nsimulation to numerically obtain the time-dependent densities and sample from\nthe diffusion process. In contrast, we propose a coupled parameterization which\njointly models a time-dependent density function, or probability path, and the\ndynamics of a diffusion process that generates this probability path. To\naccomplish this, our approach directly bakes in the Fokker-Planck equation and\ndensity function requirements as hard constraints, by extending and greatly\nsimplifying the construction of Neural Conservation Laws. This enables\nsimulation-free training for a large variety of problem formulations, from\ndata-driven objectives as in generative modeling and dynamical optimal\ntransport, to optimality-based objectives as in stochastic optimal control,\nwith straightforward extensions to mean-field objectives due to the ease of\naccessing exact density functions. We validate our method in a diverse range of\napplication domains from modeling spatio-temporal events to learning optimal\ndynamics from population data.",

This framework\nleverages a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to capture both\ndeterministic and stochastic forces. Our theoretical analysis identifies three\nprincipal factors driving the evolution: (i) the projection of gradient flows,\ninduced by the optimization dynamics, onto the operator-norm Jacobian of\nparameter matrices; (ii) the projection of gradient noise, arising from the\nrandomness in mini-batch sampling, onto the operator-norm Jacobian; and (iii)\nthe projection of the gradient noise onto the operator-norm Hessian of\nparameter matrices. Furthermore, our theoretical framework sheds light on such\nas how noisy supervision, parameter initialization, batch size, and mini-batch\nsampling trajectories, among other factors, shape the evolution of the\nLipschitz continuity of neural networks.

Creating a single platform for\nstandardized data digitization needs to overcome the inherent challenge of\nbalancing between universality (supporting the diverse, ever-evolving needs of\nvarious disciplines) and standardization (enforcing consistent formats to fully\nenable AI).

While proprietary models like GPT-4 have undergone extensive\nevaluation, the robustness of emerging open-source alternatives such as\nDeepSeek remains largely underexplored, despite their growing adoption in\nreal-world applications. In this paper, we present the first systematic\njailbreak evaluation of DeepSeek-series models, comparing them with GPT-3.5 and\nGPT-4 using the HarmBench benchmark. We evaluate seven representative attack\nstrategies across 510 harmful behaviors categorized by both function and\nsemantic domain. Our analysis reveals that DeepSeek's Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\narchitecture introduces routing sparsity that offers selective robustness\nagainst optimization-based attacks such as TAP-T, but leads to significantly\nhigher vulnerability under prompt-based and manually engineered attacks. In\ncontrast, GPT-4 Turbo demonstrates stronger and more consistent safety\nalignment across diverse behaviors, likely due to its dense Transformer design\nand reinforcement learning from human feedback. Fine-grained behavioral\nanalysis and case studies further show that DeepSeek often routes adversarial\nprompts to under-aligned expert modules, resulting in inconsistent refusal\nbehaviors. These findings highlight a fundamental trade-off between\narchitectural efficiency and alignment generalization, emphasizing the need for\ntargeted safety tuning and modular alignment strategies to ensure secure\ndeployment of open-source LLMs.",
